Generic+++$+++They do not!
Generic+++$+++They do to!
Generic+++$+++I hope so.
Generic+++$+++She okay?
Generic+++$+++Let's go.
Generic+++$+++Okay -- you're gonna need to learn how to lie.
Generic+++$+++I'm kidding.  You know how sometimes you just become this "persona"?  And you don't know how to quit?
Generic+++$+++Like my fear of wearing pastels?
Generic+++$+++The "real you".
Generic+++$+++What good stuff?
Generic+++$+++I figured you'd get to the good stuff eventually.
Generic+++$+++Thank God!  If I had to hear one more story about your coiffure...
Generic+++$+++Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like
Generic+++$+++What crap?
Generic+++$+++do you listen to this crap?
Generic+++$+++Then Guillermo says
Generic+++$+++You always been this selfish?
Generic+++$+++Then that's all you had to say.
Generic+++$+++You never wanted to go out with 'me
Generic+++$+++I was?
Generic+++$+++I looked for you back at the party
Generic+++$+++Have fun tonight?
Generic+++$+++I believe we share an art instructor
Generic+++$+++You know Chastity?
Generic+++$+++Looks like things worked out tonight
Generic+++$+++Who knows?  All I've ever heard her say is that she'd dip before dating a guy that smokes.
Generic+++$+++So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?
Generic+++$+++Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers
Generic+++$+++She's not a...
Generic+++$+++I'm workin' on it. But she doesn't seem to be goin' for him.
Generic+++$+++I really
Generic+++$+++Sure have.
Generic+++$+++Eber's Deep Conditioner every two days. And I never
Generic+++$+++How do you get your hair to look like that?
Generic+++$+++You're sweet.
Generic+++$+++You have my word.  As a gentleman
Generic+++$+++I counted on you to help my cause. You and that thug are obviously failing. Aren't we ever going on our date?
Generic+++$+++You got something on your mind?
Generic+++$+++How is our little Find the Wench A Date plan progressing?
Generic+++$+++Forget French.
Generic+++$+++That's because it's such a nice one.
Generic+++$+++I don't want to know how to say that though.  I want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are.  How much does champagne cost?  Stuff like Chat.  I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone.
Generic+++$+++Right.  See?  You're ready for the quiz.
Generic+++$+++C'esc ma tete. This is my head
Generic+++$+++Let me see what I can do.
Generic+++$+++That's a shame.
Generic+++$+++Unsolved mystery.  She used to be really popular when she started high school
Generic+++$+++Seems like she could get a date easy enough...
Generic+++$+++The thing is
Generic+++$+++Forget it.
Generic+++$+++You're asking me out.  That's so cute. What's your name again?
Generic+++$+++Okay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine.  Saturday?  Night?
Generic+++$+++Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.
Generic+++$+++Can we make this quick?  Roxanne Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break- up on the quad.  Again.
Generic+++$+++I did.
Generic+++$+++You think you ' re the only sophomore at the prom?
Generic+++$+++I don't have to be home 'til two.
Generic+++$+++I have to be home in twenty minutes.
Generic+++$+++All I know is -- I'd give up my private line to go out with a guy like Joey.
Generic+++$+++Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with
Generic+++$+++Combination.  I don't know -- I thought he'd be different.  More of a gentleman...
Generic+++$+++Is he oily or dry?
Generic+++$+++He practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist. I mean. Dr. Bonchowski is great an all
Generic+++$+++Would you mind getting me a drink
Generic+++$+++Where did he go?  He was just here.
Generic+++$+++You might wanna think about it
Generic+++$+++Did you change your hair?
Generic+++$+++You know the deal.  I can ' t go if Kat doesn't go --
Generic+++$+++You're concentrating awfully hard considering it's gym class.
Generic+++$+++My agent says I've got a good shot at being the Prada guy next year.
Generic+++$+++It's a gay cruise line
Generic+++$+++Queen Harry?
Generic+++$+++So yeah
Generic+++$+++Exactly  So
Generic+++$+++It's more
Generic+++$+++Patrick -- is that- a.
Generic+++$+++It's just you.
Generic+++$+++Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or is it just me?
Generic+++$+++No! I just wanted
Generic+++$+++What? To completely damage me?  To send me to therapy forever? What?
Generic+++$+++I just wanted --
Generic+++$+++You set me up.
Generic+++$+++Let go!
Generic+++$+++So did you
Generic+++$+++You looked beautiful last night
Generic+++$+++I guess I'll never know
Generic+++$+++Not all experiences are good
Generic+++$+++I guess I thought I was protecting you.
Generic+++$+++I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.
Generic+++$+++That's not
Generic+++$+++No. you didn't!  If you really thought I could make my own decisions
Generic+++$+++I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.
Generic+++$+++Why didn't you tell me?
Generic+++$+++After that
Generic+++$+++Just once.  Afterwards
Generic+++$+++You did what?
Generic+++$+++He said everyone was doing it.  So I did it.
Generic+++$+++As in...
Generic+++$+++Now I do.  Back then
Generic+++$+++But you hate Joey
Generic+++$+++He was
Generic+++$+++In 9th.  For a month
Generic+++$+++Joey never told you we went out
Generic+++$+++I wish I had that luxury. I'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and I can't go
Generic+++$+++I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons
Generic+++$+++Like you care.
Generic+++$+++You're welcome.
Generic+++$+++I don't get you.  You act like you're too good for any of this
Generic+++$+++I really don't think I need any social advice from you right now.
Generic+++$+++Can we go now?
Generic+++$+++You are so completely unbalanced.
Generic+++$+++It's Shakespeare.  Maybe you've heard of him?
Generic+++$+++Like I'm supposed to know what that even means.
Generic+++$+++At least I'm not a clouted fen- sucked hedge-pig.
Generic+++$+++Can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched?
Generic+++$+++Bogey Lowenstein's party is normal
Generic+++$+++What's normal?
Generic+++$+++You're ruining my life'  Because you won't be normal
Generic+++$+++I think you're a freak.  I think you do this to torture me.  And I think you suck.
Generic+++$+++What do you think?
Generic+++$+++It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going.
Generic+++$+++Oh my God
Generic+++$+++Can you at least start wearing a bra?
Generic+++$+++I have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you don't get out of my way.
Generic+++$+++Nowhere... Hi
Generic+++$+++Where've you been?
Generic+++$+++I have a date
Generic+++$+++I'm missing something.
Generic+++$+++Fine.  I see that I'm a prisoner in my own house.  I'm not a daughter. I'm a possession!
Generic+++$+++You're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story.
Generic+++$+++He's not a "hot rod".  Whatever that is.
Generic+++$+++It's that hot rod Joey
Generic+++$+++The prom?  Kat has a date?
Generic+++$+++Because she'll scare them away.
Generic+++$+++Promise me you won't talk to any boys unless your sister is present.
Generic+++$+++Just for a minute
Generic+++$+++Wear the belly before you go.
Generic+++$+++It's just a party. Daddy.
Generic+++$+++If Kat's not going
Generic+++$+++It's just a party. Daddy
Generic+++$+++Otherwise known as an orgy?
Generic+++$+++If you must know
Generic+++$+++And where're you going?
Generic+++$+++Exactly my point
Generic+++$+++But she doesn't want to date.
Generic+++$+++But it's not fair -- she's a mutant
Generic+++$+++Then neither will you.  And I'll get to sleep at night.
Generic+++$+++What if she never starts dating?
Generic+++$+++No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating.  End of discussion.
Generic+++$+++Now don't get upset. Daddy
Generic+++$+++Just sent 'em through.
Generic+++$+++Padua girls.  One tall
Generic+++$+++Fan of a fan.  You see a couple of minors come in?
Generic+++$+++Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan.  Aren't they a little too pre-teen belly-button ring for you?
Generic+++$+++Always a pleasure
Generic+++$+++Best case scenario
Generic+++$+++You humiliated the woman! Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score.
Generic+++$+++Buttholus extremus.  But hey
Generic+++$+++The hell is that?  What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her?
Generic+++$+++Extremely unfortunate maneuver.
Generic+++$+++You told me that part already.
Generic+++$+++It's her favorite band.
Generic+++$+++Assail your ears for one night.
Generic+++$+++Okay!  I wasn't sure
Generic+++$+++He's pretty!
Generic+++$+++Dead at forty-one.
Generic+++$+++Her favorite uncle
Generic+++$+++It's a lung cancer issue
Generic+++$+++Number one.  She hates smokers
Generic+++$+++Are you kidding?  He'll piss himself with joy.  He's the ultimate kiss ass.
Generic+++$+++Will Bogey get bent?
Generic+++$+++In that case
Generic+++$+++This is it.  A golden opportunity. Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.
Generic+++$+++Like we had a choice?  Besides -- when you let the enemy think he's orchestrating the battle
Generic+++$+++You got him involved?
Generic+++$+++Hey -- I've gotta have a few clients when I get to Wall Street.
Generic+++$+++I thought you hated those people.
Generic+++$+++You know
Generic+++$+++That's what I just said
Generic+++$+++Did she actually say she'd go out with you?
Generic+++$+++Forget his reputation.  Do you think we've got a plan or not?
Generic+++$+++I'm serious
Generic+++$+++They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?
Generic+++$+++No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just got out of Alcatraz...
Generic+++$+++He seems like he thrives on danger
Generic+++$+++What makes you think he'll do it?
Generic+++$+++You wanna go out with him?
Generic+++$+++What about him?
Generic+++$+++I teach her French
Generic+++$+++The mewling
Generic+++$+++That's her?  Bianca's sister?
Generic+++$+++You could consecrate with her
Generic+++$+++You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?
Generic+++$+++Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
Generic+++$+++Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
Generic+++$+++You know French?
Generic+++$+++Joey Dorsey?  Perma-shit-grin.  I wish I could say he's a moron
Generic+++$+++He always have that shit-eating grin?
Generic+++$+++Because they're bred to.  Their mothers liked guys like that
Generic+++$+++Why do girls like that always like guys like that?
Generic+++$+++I could start with your haircut
Generic+++$+++Why not?
Generic+++$+++Bianca Stratford.  Sophomore. Don't even think about it
Generic+++$+++Who is she?
Generic+++$+++You burn
Generic+++$+++That girl -- I --
Generic+++$+++That I'm used to.
Generic+++$+++Couple thousand. Most of them evil
Generic+++$+++How many people go here?
Generic+++$+++Get out!
Generic+++$+++How many people were in your old school?
Generic+++$+++Yeah.  A couple.  We're outnumbered by the cows
Generic+++$+++I was kidding. People actually live there?
Generic+++$+++So -- which Dakota you from?
Generic+++$+++C'mon.  I'm supposed to give you the tour.
Generic+++$+++So they tell me...
Generic+++$+++You the new guy?
Generic+++$+++You get the girl.
Generic+++$+++What's the worst?
Generic+++$+++She kissed me.
Generic+++$+++You makin' any headway?
Generic+++$+++She just needs time to cool off I'll give it a day.
Generic+++$+++She hates you with the fire of a thousand suns .  That's a direct quote
Generic+++$+++I don ' t know.  I decided not to nail her when she was too drunk to remember it.
Generic+++$+++What'd you do to her?
Generic+++$+++Cameron -- do you like the girl?
Generic+++$+++She's partial to Joey
Generic+++$+++What 're you talking about?
Generic+++$+++It's off. The whole thing.
Generic+++$+++Don't make me do it
Generic+++$+++Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night.
Generic+++$+++So what does that give me?  I'm supposed to buy her some noodles and a book and sit around listening to chicks who can't play their instruments?
Generic+++$+++Okay -- Likes:  Thai food
Generic+++$+++I've retrieved certain pieces of information on Miss Katarina Stratford I think you'll find helpful.
Generic+++$+++What've you got for me?
Generic+++$+++Yeah -- we'll see.
Generic+++$+++And he means that strictly in a non- prison-movie type of way.
Generic+++$+++And why would I do that?
Generic+++$+++Leave my sister alone.
Generic+++$+++Your sister here?
Generic+++$+++Where ya goin?
Generic+++$+++Not at all
Generic+++$+++Hey -- do you mind?
Generic+++$+++They're running the rest of me next month.
Generic+++$+++The vintage look is over
Generic+++$+++Enough with the Barbie n' Ken shit. I know.
Generic+++$+++I don't know
Generic+++$+++Get her to act like a human
Generic+++$+++Do what?
Generic+++$+++How'd you do it?
Generic+++$+++A deal's a deal.
Generic+++$+++It's about time.
Generic+++$+++Forget her sister
Generic+++$+++Forget it.
Generic+++$+++A hundred bucks a date.
Generic+++$+++I just upped my price
Generic+++$+++I got her under control. She just acts crazed in public to keep up the image.
Generic+++$+++Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.
Generic+++$+++I'm on it
Generic+++$+++When I shell out fifty
Generic+++$+++Take it or leave it.  This isn't a negotiation.
Generic+++$+++I can't take a girl like that out on twenty bucks.
Generic+++$+++How much?
Generic+++$+++I can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend.  And that's the catch. She doesn't want a boyfriend.
Generic+++$+++You're gonna pay me to take out some girl?
Generic+++$+++You got it
Generic+++$+++But you'd go out with her if you had the cake?
Generic+++$+++You need money to take a girl out
Generic+++$+++You just said
Generic+++$+++Two legs
Generic+++$+++What do you think?
Generic+++$+++Hey -- it's all for the higher good right?
Generic+++$+++You better not fuck this up.  I'm heavily invested.
Generic+++$+++What?  We took bathes together when we were kids.
Generic+++$+++You and Verona?
Generic+++$+++I hear you're helpin' Verona.
Generic+++$+++So what you need to do is recruit a guy who'll go out with her.  Someone who's up for the job.
Generic+++$+++Does this conversation have a purpose?
Generic+++$+++But she can't go out with you because her sister is this insane head case and no one will go out with her. right?
Generic+++$+++We're not.
Generic+++$+++We don't chat.
Generic+++$+++Nope - just came by to chat
Generic+++$+++Are you lost?
Generic+++$+++William - he asked me to meet him here.
Generic+++$+++Have you seen him?
Generic+++$+++You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective.  We're making a statement.
Generic+++$+++Listen to you!  You sound like Betty
Generic+++$+++Can you even imagine?  Who the hell would go to this a bastion of commercial excess?
Generic+++$+++I got drunk.  I puked.  I got rejected. It was big fun.
Generic+++$+++You didn't
Generic+++$+++I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.
Generic+++$+++You didn't have a choice?  Where's Kat and what have you done with her?
Generic+++$+++I didn't have a choice.
Generic+++$+++You went to the party?  I thought we were officially opposed to suburban social activity.
Generic+++$+++Who cares?
Generic+++$+++What'd he say?
Generic+++$+++No fear.
Generic+++$+++You think this'll work?
Generic+++$+++If I was Bianca
Generic+++$+++Does it matter?
Generic+++$+++I appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death
Generic+++$+++Neither has his heterosexuality.
Generic+++$+++That's never been proven
Generic+++$+++William didn't even go to high school
Generic+++$+++William would never have gone to a state school.
Generic+++$+++So he has this huge raging fit about Sarah Lawrence and insists that I go to his male-dominated
Generic+++$+++You could always go with me.  I'm sure William has some friends.
Generic+++$+++The people at this school are so incredibly foul.
Generic+++$+++But imagine the things he'd say during sex.
Generic+++$+++I realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking
Generic+++$+++An attempted slit.
Generic+++$+++What's this?
Generic+++$+++Just a little.
Generic+++$+++Block E?
Generic+++$+++He always look so
Generic+++$+++I'm sure he's completely incapable of doing anything that interesting.
Generic+++$+++That's Pat Verona? The one who was gone for a year? I heard he was doing porn movies.
Generic+++$+++Patrick Verona   Random skid.
Generic+++$+++Who's that?
Generic+++$+++Don ' t you even dare. . .
Generic+++$+++Because I like to torture you.
Generic+++$+++Why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill?
Generic+++$+++Is that right?
Generic+++$+++I thought you could use it. When you start your band.
Generic+++$+++A Fender Strat. You bought this?
Generic+++$+++I didn't care about the money.
Generic+++$+++Really?  What was it like?  A down payment now
Generic+++$+++It wasn't like that.
Generic+++$+++You were paid to take me out!  By -- the one person I truly hate.  I knew it was a set-up!
Generic+++$+++Wait I...
Generic+++$+++It gets worse -- you still have your freshman yearbook?
Generic+++$+++That ' s completely adorable!
Generic+++$+++That's where I was last year.  She'd never lived alone -- my grandfather died -- I stayed with her.  I wasn't in jail
Generic+++$+++My grandmother's .
Generic+++$+++Oh huh
Generic+++$+++It's just something I had.  You know
Generic+++$+++It's Scurvy's.  His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?
Generic+++$+++How'd you get a tux at the last minute?
Generic+++$+++Nothing!  There's nothing in it for me. Just the pleasure of your company.
Generic+++$+++Answer the question
Generic+++$+++You need therapy.  Has anyone ever told you that?
Generic+++$+++You tell me.
Generic+++$+++So I have to have a motive to be with you?
Generic+++$+++Create a little drama?  Start a new rumor?  What?
Generic+++$+++Because I don't want to. It's a stupid tradition.
Generic+++$+++Why not?
Generic+++$+++No what?
Generic+++$+++You know what I mean
Generic+++$+++Is that a request or a command?
Generic+++$+++Go to the prom with me
Generic+++$+++You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that?
Generic+++$+++No one else knows
Generic+++$+++You're sweet.  And sexy.  And completely hot for me.
Generic+++$+++No -- something real.  Something no one else knows.
Generic+++$+++I hate peas.
Generic+++$+++Tell me something true.
Generic+++$+++I know the porn career's a lie.
Generic+++$+++The duck?
Generic+++$+++State trooper?
Generic+++$+++For. . . ?
Generic+++$+++You up for it?
Generic+++$+++You never disappointed me.
Generic+++$+++Then you screwed up
Generic+++$+++Something like that
Generic+++$+++So if you disappoint them from the start
Generic+++$+++I don't like to do what people expect. Then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change.
Generic+++$+++Acting the way we do.
Generic+++$+++So what's your excuse?
Generic+++$+++A soft side? Who knew?
Generic+++$+++I dazzled him with my wit
Generic+++$+++So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way?
Generic+++$+++Good call.
Generic+++$+++I figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect.  And piss you off.
Generic+++$+++The Partridge Family?
Generic+++$+++You want me to climb up and show you how to get down?
Generic+++$+++Forget it.  I'm stayin'.
Generic+++$+++Put your right foot there --
Generic+++$+++Try lookin' at it from this angle
Generic+++$+++C'mon.  It's not that bad
Generic+++$+++I guess I never told you I'm afraid of heights.
Generic+++$+++Look up
Generic+++$+++He left!  I sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me.
Generic+++$+++Other than my upchuck reflex? Nothing.
Generic+++$+++So what did I have an effect on ?
Generic+++$+++Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties.
Generic+++$+++Unwelcome?  I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
Generic+++$+++You 're so --
Generic+++$+++I heard there was a poetry reading.
Generic+++$+++What are you doing here?
Generic+++$+++Excuse me
Generic+++$+++No offense
Generic+++$+++He just wants me to be someone I'm not.
Generic+++$+++So what ' s up with your dad?  He a pain in the ass?
Generic+++$+++I'm gettin' there
Generic+++$+++You don't strike me as the type that would ask permission.
Generic+++$+++My father wouldn't approve of that that
Generic+++$+++Start a band?
Generic+++$+++Do what?
Generic+++$+++I should do this.
Generic+++$+++Why'd you lie?
Generic+++$+++Then why'd you ask?
Generic+++$+++Were you in jail?
Generic+++$+++When you were gone last year -- where were you?
Generic+++$+++But it's Gigglepuss - I know you like them.  I saw you there.
Generic+++$+++And I'm in control of it.
Generic+++$+++Kat! Wake up!
Generic+++$+++You know what they say
Generic+++$+++I thought you were above all that
Generic+++$+++Hey man. . .  You don ' t think I can be "cool"?  You don't think I can be "laid back" like everyone else?
Generic+++$+++I know.  It'd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila. You don't seem like the type.
Generic+++$+++I hate him.
Generic+++$+++Why'd you let him get to you?
Generic+++$+++Just let me sit down.
Generic+++$+++See that?  Who needs affection when I've got blind hatred?
Generic+++$+++Like you could find one
Generic+++$+++Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.
Generic+++$+++You don't care if I die
Generic+++$+++I told you
Generic+++$+++Why 're you doing this?
Generic+++$+++Leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced.
Generic+++$+++This is so patronizing.
Generic+++$+++What if you have a concussion? My dog went to sleep with a concussion and woke up a vegetable. Not that I could tell the difference...
Generic+++$+++I know
Generic+++$+++I just need to lie down for awhile
Generic+++$+++You're not okay.
Generic+++$+++I'm fine. I'm
Generic+++$+++I say
Generic+++$+++"I'm getting trashed
Generic+++$+++What's this?
Generic+++$+++You know who The Raincoats are?
Generic+++$+++You know
Generic+++$+++Do you mind?  You're sort of ruining it for me.
Generic+++$+++That's what you want
Generic+++$+++Excuse me?
Generic+++$+++hey.  Great show
Generic+++$+++Depends on the topic. My fenders don't really whip me into a verbal frenzy.
Generic+++$+++You're not a big talker
Generic+++$+++I was in the laundromat. I saw your car. Thought I'd say hi.
Generic+++$+++Are you following me?
Generic+++$+++You -- covered in my vomit.
Generic+++$+++Come on -- the ponies
Generic+++$+++And why would I do that?
Generic+++$+++Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me.
Generic+++$+++I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion.
Generic+++$+++You hate me don't you?
Generic+++$+++I know a lot more than that
Generic+++$+++Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name
Generic+++$+++The night I take you to places you've never been before.  And back.
Generic+++$+++Pick you up Friday
Generic+++$+++My mission in life.
Generic+++$+++There's a way to get a guy's attention.
Generic+++$+++Sweating like a pig
Generic+++$+++I mean Wo-man.  How ya doin'?
Generic+++$+++When I go?
Generic+++$+++You know
Generic+++$+++No -- impressed.
Generic+++$+++What's the matter?  Upset that I rubbed off on her?
Generic+++$+++Bianca did what?
Generic+++$+++The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.
Generic+++$+++Which parts?
Generic+++$+++Parts of it.
Generic+++$+++So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?
Generic+++$+++I don't understand the allure of dehydrated food.  Is this something I should be hip to?
Generic+++$+++Yeah.  She left with some bikers Big ones.  Full of sperm.
Generic+++$+++Was that your sister?
Generic+++$+++I want to go to an East Coast school! I want you to trust me to make my own choices.  I want --
Generic+++$+++You're eighteen.  You don't know what you want.  You won't know until you're forty-five and you don't have it.
Generic+++$+++So what I want doesn't matter?
Generic+++$+++As a parent
Generic+++$+++Because you're making decisions for me.
Generic+++$+++Why can't we agree on this?
Generic+++$+++I thought you were punishing me.
Generic+++$+++Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?
Generic+++$+++Then tell them I had a seizure.
Generic+++$+++My insurance does not cover PMS
Generic+++$+++This from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips?
Generic+++$+++You decided.
Generic+++$+++I thought we decided you were going to school here.  At U of 0.
Generic+++$+++I know.
Generic+++$+++Just smack her now.
Generic+++$+++Am I supposed to feel better? Like
Generic+++$+++No ... I believe "heinous bitch" is the term used most often.
Generic+++$+++The point is Kat -- people perceive you as somewhat ...
Generic+++$+++I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls.  I was merely a spectator.
Generic+++$+++Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.
Generic+++$+++Katarina Stratford.  My
Generic+++$+++Kat a fan
Generic+++$+++Oh yeah.
Generic+++$+++You think?
Generic+++$+++Yeah.  I guess.
Generic+++$+++Cool pictures.  You a fan?
Generic+++$+++Hey there.  Tired of breathing?
Generic+++$+++Man -- don't say shit like that to  me. People can hear you.
Generic+++$+++Sweet love
Generic+++$+++You were right. She's still pissed.
Generic+++$+++No - I've got a sweet-payin' job that I'm about to lose.
Generic+++$+++So you got cozy with she who stings?
Generic+++$+++I'm likin' you guys better
Generic+++$+++I prefer to think of it simply as an alternative to what the law allows.
Generic+++$+++Ever been to Club Skunk?
Generic+++$+++Just for now.
Generic+++$+++Are you telling me I'm a -  "non-smoker"?
Generic+++$+++Good enough.
Generic+++$+++We're your guys.
Generic+++$+++You two are gonna help me tame the wild beast?
Generic+++$+++So Dorsey can get the girl?
Generic+++$+++That's where we can help you.  With Kat.
Generic+++$+++Dorsey can plow whoever he wants. I'm just in this for the cash.
Generic+++$+++I think I speak correctly when I say that Cameron's love is pure.  Purer than say -- Joey Dorsey's.
Generic+++$+++What is it with this chick?  She have three tits?
Generic+++$+++The situation is
Generic+++$+++What plan?
Generic+++$+++Whatever the hell it is you're standin' there waitin' to say.
Generic+++$+++Say it
Generic+++$+++See you next week!
Generic+++$+++You're completely demented.
Generic+++$+++You weren't abused
Generic+++$+++What's to discuss?
Generic+++$+++Why don't we discuss your driving need to be a hemorrhoid?
Generic+++$+++I'm at a loss
Generic+++$+++Touch of the flu.
Generic+++$+++I don't understand
Generic+++$+++With the teeth of your zipper?
Generic+++$+++It was a bratwurst.  I was eating lunch.
Generic+++$+++It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls.
Generic+++$+++I missed you.
Generic+++$+++That ' s what I thought
Generic+++$+++Absolutely not.
Generic+++$+++Did I have anything to say about it?
Generic+++$+++Your daughters went to the prom.
Generic+++$+++What just happened?
Generic+++$+++But -- who -- what --?
Generic+++$+++Have a great time
Generic+++$+++Dr. Ruth?
Generic+++$+++What do you wanna watch?  We've got crap
Generic+++$+++Kissing?  Is that what you think happens?  Kissing isn't what keeps me up to my elbows in placenta all day.
Generic+++$+++They'll dance
Generic+++$+++Pirate -- no question.
Generic+++$+++Would you rather be ravished by a pirate or a British rear admiral?
Generic+++$+++You're not helping.
Generic+++$+++Jesus!  Can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating?
Generic+++$+++Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of the country.
Generic+++$+++What's a synonym for throbbing?
Generic+++$+++Make anyone cry today?
Generic+++$+++In the microwave.
Generic+++$+++Can't be that far
Generic+++$+++We left three weeks ago
Generic+++$+++We should have seen land.
Generic+++$+++We'll all go crazy...
Generic+++$+++He's the devil's child...
Generic+++$+++With a face like that?  I don't want you looking at me.  You hear?
Generic+++$+++What are you listening to
Generic+++$+++You'll be drinking your own piss... For the glory of Spain... and Admiral Colon...!  Bastard!
Generic+++$+++The water's going putrid in the barrels.
Generic+++$+++I never seen heat like this!  Not even in Las Minas!
Generic+++$+++Asia can be found to the west -- and I will prove it.
Generic+++$+++Blind faith is what I consider heresy!
Generic+++$+++Don't you realize your words could be considered heretical?
Generic+++$+++Did He not choose a carpenter's son to reveal Himself to the world?
Generic+++$+++If God intended our proximity to Asia
Generic+++$+++No.  The Portuguese have already discovered black-skinned people.  I
Generic+++$+++Is that all that interests you? Gold?
Generic+++$+++If they agree to follow me
Generic+++$+++Your life
Generic+++$+++Your Eminence
Generic+++$+++Senor Colon
Generic+++$+++Then you cannot ignore that according to their calculations
Generic+++$+++I am
Generic+++$+++You say Asia can be found by sailing west?
Generic+++$+++A waste...?  Let me tell you something
Generic+++$+++What a tragedy... what a waste of a life...
Generic+++$+++You can see for yourself.
Generic+++$+++On the contrary
Generic+++$+++It won't be easy to get rid of your prophet now
Generic+++$+++Indeed.  The world is full of mercenaries -- and states often make use of them
Generic+++$+++He is a mercenary!  Did he not already try to convince the King of Portugal of his absurd notions?
Generic+++$+++Naturally.  But I would really deplore the loss of such a potential opportunity for Spain for a... dispute over a point of geography.
Generic+++$+++The Judgment is ours!
Generic+++$+++The State has some reason to be interested in this man's proposition
Generic+++$+++I can't keep my eyes off you.  I would like to catch up with all the moments I didn't spend with you.
Generic+++$+++What is it
Generic+++$+++I am busy inside.
Generic+++$+++Can't you stay with us a little?
Generic+++$+++Not everything... Do you think I care?  I'm a free man again.  Riches don't make a man rich
Generic+++$+++They took everything...
Generic+++$+++They tried... but I didn't let them.
Generic+++$+++God... you're so beautiful!  I can't believe no other man has ever taken you away from me...
Generic+++$+++I can arrange for the Queen to take Fernando and Diego into her service.
Generic+++$+++You don't usually ask.
Generic+++$+++That's something you can't decide.
Generic+++$+++I don't want you to wait for me.
Generic+++$+++I'm not asking you to swear to anything.
Generic+++$+++Thank God...
Generic+++$+++She said yes.
Generic+++$+++I find that hard to believe.
Generic+++$+++Perhaps I was never meant to live with a woman...
Generic+++$+++I'd love to argue with you sometimes.  But you're never here!
Generic+++$+++Are we going to argue?
Generic+++$+++Well... that's true.  I have a child by a man who won't marry me!  Who's always leaving...
Generic+++$+++I haven't given you much of a life.
Generic+++$+++I know.
Generic+++$+++I could be gone for years.
Generic+++$+++I am afraid this is not the worst news.
Generic+++$+++How could I be?  The mainland has been found.  Exactly as I said it would.
Generic+++$+++I am not a seaman.  But I heard it is no more than a week at sea.  I hope you are not too disappointed.
Generic+++$+++How far from here?
Generic+++$+++Congratulations.  Then I am free to search for the mainland.
Generic+++$+++Viceroy of the West Indies.
Generic+++$+++Appointment to what?
Generic+++$+++My letters of appointment.
Generic+++$+++Yes... I remember...
Generic+++$+++Don Alonso de Bobadilla.
Generic+++$+++Bartolome and Giacomo Colon.
Generic+++$+++May I ask by whom?
Generic+++$+++Forgive me
Generic+++$+++I understand that you will soon be appointing Governors for the islands?  Is it not so?
Generic+++$+++Tell me the first thing that comes to your mind.
Generic+++$+++Really?  God... I wouldn't know where to start... and yet...
Generic+++$+++I want you to tell me everything you remember
Generic+++$+++He never had one... except aboard my ships!
Generic+++$+++He asks when he can come to visit you.  He left his address.
Generic+++$+++What does he say?
Generic+++$+++I am not listening
Generic+++$+++What are you listening to?
Generic+++$+++There must be a passage to that other ocean.
Generic+++$+++Not bad.
Generic+++$+++How are you feeling
Generic+++$+++This time with me!
Generic+++$+++I have to explore the mainland.
Generic+++$+++Yes... Yes
Generic+++$+++Do you swear on all the Holy Saints in heaven?
Generic+++$+++You promise?  Do you swear on St. Christopher...?
Generic+++$+++There'll be a time.
Generic+++$+++I want to go with you!
Generic+++$+++All of them created by people like me.
Generic+++$+++Roofs... towers
Generic+++$+++What do you see?
Generic+++$+++Look out of that window.
Generic+++$+++I am not afraid of you.  You are nothing but a dreamer.
Generic+++$+++Call them.
Generic+++$+++All I have to do is call the guards.
Generic+++$+++To rise so high
Generic+++$+++What...?  Do I have so many already?
Generic+++$+++You seem to have a special talent for making friends.
Generic+++$+++Good!  We are also in need of judges.  Except there are no thieves!
Generic+++$+++Don Bobadilla is already a judge
Generic+++$+++But we do have a lack of notaries. You should contact my administration.
Generic+++$+++... for a commoner?
Generic+++$+++You defend yourself admirably...
Generic+++$+++Forgive me
Generic+++$+++They don't see sin in their nakedness.  They live according to nature
Generic+++$+++If you won't accept our proposal
Generic+++$+++And were you never ambitious
Generic+++$+++Then you are too ambitious.
Generic+++$+++I'm not bargaining!
Generic+++$+++I remind you
Generic+++$+++NO...!  I have waited too long
Generic+++$+++You never learned how to speak my language.
Generic+++$+++You did the same to your God!
Generic+++$+++You have to find them
Generic+++$+++Ask him if he will help.
Generic+++$+++He understands.
Generic+++$+++We will work with his people.  We want peace.  Ask the Chief if he understands?
Generic+++$+++He has medicine.  Tell him we admire his people.
Generic+++$+++Chief says...
Generic+++$+++... and also to bring medicine.
Generic+++$+++Chief says -- he has a God.
Generic+++$+++To bring the word of God.
Generic+++$+++Chief says -- how many?
Generic+++$+++Tell him his country is very beautiful.  Tell him we are leaving men here -- to build a fort.
Generic+++$+++Chief knows.
Generic+++$+++Tell the Chief we thank him.
Generic+++$+++You come!  You speak first!
Generic+++$+++Island.  Far.
Generic+++$+++What is it?  A tribe?  An island?
Generic+++$+++Say not here!  Cuba!
Generic+++$+++I don't know... I have the impression that I didn't change that much.  I still can't accept the world as it is!
Generic+++$+++Oh?  So you are a new man?
Generic+++$+++New worlds create new people.
Generic+++$+++I knew you would.
Generic+++$+++I have to disagree.
Generic+++$+++You'll always be older than me
Generic+++$+++I suppose we're both old men now.
Generic+++$+++Give me absolution.
Generic+++$+++I believed in you...
Generic+++$+++You are bound by an oath
Generic+++$+++My son
Generic+++$+++If I tell them
Generic+++$+++May God forgive you...!  You must tell them!  You must tell your men!
Generic+++$+++I am not sure... It could be twice the distance.
Generic+++$+++How long?
Generic+++$+++I lied.  The journey will be longer than I said.
Generic+++$+++What are you saying?
Generic+++$+++I am listening
Generic+++$+++Forgive me
Generic+++$+++In Nomine Patris et Filius
Generic+++$+++Colon!  Don't!
Generic+++$+++All of them!  Just lies!
Generic+++$+++Damn all of you!  You all set up theories based on what?  You never leave the safety of your studies! Go out!  Find out what the world is about and then tell me something I can listen to!
Generic+++$+++Damn God!
Generic+++$+++If God intends you to go
Generic+++$+++Wait!  I've waited seven years already!  How much longer do you want me to wait?
Generic+++$+++You mustn't give way to despair. You must wait.
Generic+++$+++Only God knows the meaning of such words
Generic+++$+++I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!
Generic+++$+++You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!
Generic+++$+++Passion is something one cannot control!
Generic+++$+++Father Marchena!
Generic+++$+++I'll try to remember that
Generic+++$+++Two minutes... and already you're a dead man.  Don't let passion overwhelm you
Generic+++$+++So was Christ!
Generic+++$+++Esdras is a Jew.
Generic+++$+++The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr
Generic+++$+++How can you be so certain?
Generic+++$+++Ignorance!  I believe the Indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the Canary Islands.
Generic+++$+++How can you be so certain?  The Ocean is said to be infinite.
Generic+++$+++To open a new route to Asia.  At the moment there are only two ways of reaching it...
Generic+++$+++Why do you wish to sail west?
Generic+++$+++With some difficulty.  I had to promise them you were not a total fool.
Generic+++$+++How did you manage it?
Generic+++$+++That's what it says.
Generic+++$+++God... That's in a week!
Generic+++$+++Diego is a bright boy -- a pleasure to teach -- but so serious... Brothers should be raised together
Generic+++$+++Your Majesty -- some men are content to read about things.  I must see them with my own eyes.  I cannot be other than I am.
Generic+++$+++There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back
Generic+++$+++Thank you.
Generic+++$+++But without your brothers.  Nor are you to return to Santo Domingo or any of the other colonies.  You may explore the continent.
Generic+++$+++They come and go as naked as the day God created them...
Generic+++$+++Do they have such thoughts?
Generic+++$+++Thirty seven
Generic+++$+++How old are you
Generic+++$+++A woman?
Generic+++$+++I know what I see.  I see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is.  Who's not afraid.  I see a women who thinks... "What if?"...
Generic+++$+++You show no inclination to speak otherwise!
Generic+++$+++May I speak freely?
Generic+++$+++Surely you can do anything you want.
Generic+++$+++I cannot ignore the verdict of my council.
Generic+++$+++That she was impregnable.
Generic+++$+++What did they say about Granada before today?
Generic+++$+++The ocean is uncrossable?
Generic+++$+++No more than the woman who said she would take Granada from the Moors.
Generic+++$+++I should not even be listening to you
Generic+++$+++You will regret this.
Generic+++$+++You'll be held in detention
Generic+++$+++Savagery is what monkeys understand.
Generic+++$+++In one act of brutality
Generic+++$+++You did not hear me
Generic+++$+++Don Moxica -- we all have to work.
Generic+++$+++My horse doesn't work.
Generic+++$+++We can't raise the wheel without it.
Generic+++$+++We came here to stay!  To build! Not to start a crusade.  In this forest
Generic+++$+++We don't need to know.
Generic+++$+++You want a war?  Fine.  We are a thousand.  They outnumber us by ten! Who will you kill?  Which tribe?
Generic+++$+++If you want to keep your head on your shoulders
Generic+++$+++We lost cousins
Generic+++$+++The Indians have no such word
Generic+++$+++And you say this is an Indian vice? By God!  I don't see any kind of pleasure that would make this a sin.
Generic+++$+++We can't be.
Generic+++$+++He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus.
Generic+++$+++What's he doing?
Generic+++$+++Twenty eight.
Generic+++$+++What do you read?
Generic+++$+++Come over here.
Generic+++$+++And what do you think Mendez?
Generic+++$+++Well... It's the men
Generic+++$+++God be with us admiral.
Generic+++$+++Due west
Generic+++$+++You're right.  Let the men decide.
Generic+++$+++You tell that to them!
Generic+++$+++You bloody...
Generic+++$+++You never did.  You did all the talking for both of us
Generic+++$+++Jesus Maria!  I should have never listened to you!
Generic+++$+++And then what?  Half of the water has gone
Generic+++$+++You don't know anything!  Listen Colon
Generic+++$+++The land is there.  I know it!
Generic+++$+++We're lost!
Generic+++$+++You think I don't know that?
Generic+++$+++We're on the verge of a mutiny
Generic+++$+++We have to keep the hopes of these men alive!
Generic+++$+++You must be mad...!
Generic+++$+++Six days ago
Generic+++$+++You lied!  You cheated!  We're way past 750 leagues!
Generic+++$+++Where can I meet this man?
Generic+++$+++Because he is not afraid of me.
Generic+++$+++Then why?
Generic+++$+++I know
Generic+++$+++And who would you think of
Generic+++$+++He must be replaced.
Generic+++$+++Is this true
Generic+++$+++... But there is worse.  He ordered the execution of five members of the nobility...
Generic+++$+++We weren't expecting immediate profits
Generic+++$+++Every ship returns with a cargo of sick and dying.  But with no gold! The new world proves expensive
Generic+++$+++Yes.  It would be a pity
Generic+++$+++... Into a monk...
Generic+++$+++You were right
Generic+++$+++Is that the man I knew
Generic+++$+++...so we kill someone famous and if we are caught
Generic+++$+++I don't think it's abuse
Generic+++$+++I'm abused.  Don't you think?
Generic+++$+++Can I see your back?
Generic+++$+++Out on my back when I was a small boy.
Generic+++$+++Your father put cigarettes out on you?
Generic+++$+++That's what he did to me.  He put cigarettes out on me.
Generic+++$+++Your father blamed you for your mother's blindness?
Generic+++$+++Back in the Czech Republic?
Generic+++$+++Your mother was blind?
Generic+++$+++My father always degraded me.  Killed my self-esteem.  And my mother was blind.
Generic+++$+++Tell me about yourself.  What you did as a young boy... what your parents were like.
Generic+++$+++Give me another one
Generic+++$+++I need to know about your background.  I need to know about your upbringing.  Why you're here.
Generic+++$+++What else do you need?
Generic+++$+++This is not about money
Generic+++$+++Thirty-percent.  No more.  Or I call another lawyer.  This is the biggest case of your life.  Don't try to negotiate.  Thirty percent.  Say yes or no.
Generic+++$+++But it's...
Generic+++$+++No.  No way.
Generic+++$+++I would say...half.  Half is fair.
Generic+++$+++What's your cut?  How much?
Generic+++$+++What about my movie rights?  Book rights?
Generic+++$+++Don't worry about him.  Think about yourself.
Generic+++$+++Disappeared.  They're looking everywhere.  Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia.
Generic+++$+++What about Oleg?
Generic+++$+++I was all of these.
Generic+++$+++...delusions and paranoia.
Generic+++$+++You bring the cigarettes?
Generic+++$+++I brought you some letters.  It's really fan mail.  Women mostly.  One wants to buy you clothes
Generic+++$+++I'm invoking rights - this man is represented by counsel.  I'm coming with him.
Generic+++$+++Yes.  Yes
Generic+++$+++I'm coming with you.
Generic+++$+++Where are we going?
Generic+++$+++Don't say anything.
Generic+++$+++He has the camera!  He took the movie!
Generic+++$+++Emil.  Take it easy.  Stay with me.  Sit down.  What do you need?  What are you looking for?
Generic+++$+++Oh no!  No!  Shit!
Generic+++$+++Here.  I have your money.
Generic+++$+++I'm not your lawyer until I see the money.
Generic+++$+++Are you my attorney?  I'm Emil.  I'm insane.
Generic+++$+++I don't want to drag you down with me.
Generic+++$+++...Do you really want me to forget about you?
Generic+++$+++Forget about me.  You have enough problems of your own.
Generic+++$+++Pouring it out!
Generic+++$+++What are you doing?
Generic+++$+++I'll get my clothes.
Generic+++$+++I'll make some for us.
Generic+++$+++In the kitchen.
Generic+++$+++Do you have coffee?
Generic+++$+++You better get packed.
Generic+++$+++I'm glad I met you.
Generic+++$+++No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you.
Generic+++$+++A good Immigration lawyer could stall the process.  Eddie recommended one.
Generic+++$+++If you were my boyfriend
Generic+++$+++If I was your boyfriend
Generic+++$+++Ludwig?  He's gay - are you jealous?
Generic+++$+++Is he your boyfriend?
Generic+++$+++I'm sorry.
Generic+++$+++I still can't believe Eddie's gone.
Generic+++$+++Are you alright?
Generic+++$+++I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to...I'm glad. Actually I'm glad it's over.  All this time.  Hiding.  Never being able to look anyone in the eyes. Always afraid that someone would find out who I was.  Never trusting anyone...
Generic+++$+++They're not gonna send you right back.
Generic+++$+++You don't know.  I'm sorry.  I was desperate.  That's not me.  I shot a cop.  Can you imagine what they'll do to me when I got to prison?
Generic+++$+++I know.
Generic+++$+++I'm not a whore.  I'm not a whore.
Generic+++$+++I'm just trying to find out who you are.
Generic+++$+++What are you asking me?
Generic+++$+++So you were never a prostitute?
Generic+++$+++I came here.  I had no money.  I knew no one.  I couldn't get a job because you have to have a green card to get work. They approached me - I could've made a lot of money.  I considered it
Generic+++$+++What about back home?
Generic+++$+++Did you ever turn tricks before?
Generic+++$+++You considered becoming a prostitute?
Generic+++$+++Yeah.  This way.
Generic+++$+++So...the station is empty?
Generic+++$+++The men are out of quarters - practicing putting out fires.
Generic+++$+++Somewhere else?
Generic+++$+++I can't take you to my place.
Generic+++$+++Do you live alone?  I've been in these clothes since...the killings.  Could we stop at your place? I could take a shower...before I go into custody?
Generic+++$+++Are you married?
Generic+++$+++They won't until this is over.
Generic+++$+++I will if they don't send me back.
Generic+++$+++If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they'll help you with your situation.
Generic+++$+++Now I become custody of police department?
Generic+++$+++Alright.  That's a justifiable homicide.
Generic+++$+++...my little sister and I shared a flat - I came home one night and a man was raping her.  His gun was on the chair... He came at me and I shot him.
Generic+++$+++You're a cop - you'll never believe me.
Generic+++$+++I'm from a small town in Slovakia.  Like the South here.  The Police is right
Generic+++$+++A cop?
Generic+++$+++Are you here illegally?  Don't worry about that.  We'll talk to Immigration. They won't deport you.
Generic+++$+++Arrest you for what?  Why would we arrest you?
Generic+++$+++If I tell you
Generic+++$+++Whether you tell us or not
Generic+++$+++Go on.
Generic+++$+++Tamina was a friend of mine.  My shower was broken
Generic+++$+++I told your partner
Generic+++$+++I'm ready to be briefed.  Excuse us.
Generic+++$+++Oh yeah...?  Alright.
Generic+++$+++It was my decision
Generic+++$+++There's nothing to talk about.  Get a good lawyer.  You're suspended until your trial.
Generic+++$+++But Chief?  Over this??
Generic+++$+++How are you going to fight this?  Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page
Generic+++$+++End my career?
Generic+++$+++Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine.
Generic+++$+++Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian.
Generic+++$+++Forgot?  You handcuffed a civilian to a tree?!
Generic+++$+++What was I supposed to do?  The guy tried to mug me.  I was gonna send a cop back - I just forgot.
Generic+++$+++The public doesn't have any idea what we do and now you're going to define our image!  This is going to be our Rodney King!
Generic+++$+++Okay.  But not water sports.
Generic+++$+++Chief - mind if I take her?
Generic+++$+++Oh really.  That's nice.  You took a homicide witness to take a shower after your partner was shot?  Are you out of your fucking mind??  Are you having that much trouble gettin' dates?!
Generic+++$+++No!  Nothing happened.
Generic+++$+++A shower!?  Did you take one
Generic+++$+++I let her take a shower.
Generic+++$+++What do you mean
Generic+++$+++Ladder 20 was on the Rock for training. We stopped there... so she could get cleaned up.
Generic+++$+++I came to see how the investigation was going.  I called and you're not here.  I wait up at the station and you don't even show up!!!  I beep you - you don't return my call.  Where the hell have you been?!
Generic+++$+++'Cause we got more important things to do
Generic+++$+++Then why didn't you talk to the reporter?
Generic+++$+++Who do you think
Generic+++$+++Who did cause and origin?
Generic+++$+++Alright.  Swing by her apartment.  Let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to Hoover Street.  You got that?
Generic+++$+++Yeah.  He finished awhile ago.
Generic+++$+++Did the D.A. videotape her deposition?
Generic+++$+++You do that
Generic+++$+++I said
Generic+++$+++What was that
Generic+++$+++Don't you guys understand?  It's all about image.  The better we look the more money I get to pay you guys overtime.
Generic+++$+++I know.  Relax.  Take it easy.  Don't worry
Generic+++$+++He got my gun!  Motherfucker was filming the whole time!
Generic+++$+++No.  I'm okay.
Generic+++$+++Are you hit?
Generic+++$+++Stay with her.
Generic+++$+++The other side of the street.  The guy with the videocamera.  Don't look - put her in the car.  Stay this side.
Generic+++$+++C'mere.  You wanna go to homicide school?  Here - make yourself useful.
Generic+++$+++Only one guys checked in?
Generic+++$+++It's okay.
Generic+++$+++Sorry...PD only.
Generic+++$+++Still unknown but we're running prints. Kid over there caught the case.
Generic+++$+++Any I.D.?
Generic+++$+++Takin' a bath.
Generic+++$+++Where is she?
Generic+++$+++A timer.
Generic+++$+++What's he looking for?
Generic+++$+++You ready?
Generic+++$+++Tomorrow.  At lunch.
Generic+++$+++I'm gonna propose.
Generic+++$+++What's the kid gonna say - sorry? Meanwhile I'm not here anymore. Like last week - we were at the morgue and this guy was all chopped up - spleen here - liver there - his heart in a pan. Six hours ago this guy was walkin' his dog or buyin' a quart of milk.  Who knows?  But some kid's robbed him for $3 or some shit and shot him and now you can't tell if he's a piece of beef or a human being and I'm thinkin' that's me. Sooner or later.  That's me.
Generic+++$+++It was freaky
Generic+++$+++Maybe you could just put in a shot of Martell?
Generic+++$+++Vodka tonic.
Generic+++$+++Coffee for me
Generic+++$+++She washes hair up at Ludwig's - a salon on 63rd and Madison.
Generic+++$+++He had a videocamera?  Where is she? Quickly!
Generic+++$+++Describe him.
Generic+++$+++He said he was her cousin.  I told him where she works.  They were just here.
Generic+++$+++Daphne.  Another guy came in asking me about her
Generic+++$+++What are you saying?
Generic+++$+++Did you tell him you did?
Generic+++$+++Do you have any Czech girls working for you?
Generic+++$+++Yeah.  He wanted a girl from Czechoslovakia
Generic+++$+++Oh my G-d.  Honey!  Honey's dead?
Generic+++$+++We don't have her I.D. yet
Generic+++$+++What's wrong?
Generic+++$+++I have nothin' to say.  If you wanna contact my attorney...
Generic+++$+++Police.  We'd like to ask you a few questions.
Generic+++$+++Who's there?
Generic+++$+++You know
Generic+++$+++Why'd you help me back there with the Chief?  Why'd you stand up for me like that?
Generic+++$+++How you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an Immigration lawyer.  Here
Generic+++$+++I told you
Generic+++$+++Just a shower?
Generic+++$+++I took her there for a shower and that's it.
Generic+++$+++Women like that have a way of turning professionals into amateurs.
Generic+++$+++Hey.  I'm a professional.
Generic+++$+++You know what I'm saying here.
Generic+++$+++You're her Savior?  Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?
Generic+++$+++C'mon.  You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity.  She sees me differently.
Generic+++$+++So am I.
Generic+++$+++I'm serious here.
Generic+++$+++My point exactly.
Generic+++$+++I don't have a girlfriend.
Generic+++$+++What would your girlfriend think of that?
Generic+++$+++You wanna talk to her alone?
Generic+++$+++Look - let me talk to her.  Any leads I get
Generic+++$+++Raw deal.
Generic+++$+++She's fucked.  Even if that story is true.
Generic+++$+++Something back home?
Generic+++$+++Why not?
Generic+++$+++Is that all there is?
Generic+++$+++She just saw two of her friends killed! They probably threatened her.
Generic+++$+++What are you hiding?  Why are you afraid
Generic+++$+++Then I guess we're doin' this the right way
Generic+++$+++I wanted to run up to a building on fire
Generic+++$+++Hey!  I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid.  I dreamed of running up to a door
Generic+++$+++Of course.
Generic+++$+++So am I.  Alright
Generic+++$+++I'm on duty.
Generic+++$+++You thirsty?
Generic+++$+++I'm on my way with Eddie.  Ludwig's. 63rd and Madison.  The suspects might be there already.
Generic+++$+++Leon - meet us at 63rd and Madison. Hair salon.  Ludwig's.
Generic+++$+++Better than one.
Generic+++$+++Two heads.
Generic+++$+++I'll call it... tails.
Generic+++$+++Tell you what - I'll flip you a coin. If you win you can come with me.  If you don't win
Generic+++$+++This is ridiculous.  I'm not gonna be in your way - we can talk the case over.
Generic+++$+++I'll let you know what happens.
Generic+++$+++But what if it does?  You might need my help.
Generic+++$+++This has nothing to do with your fire.
Generic+++$+++Mind if I ride along with you?
Generic+++$+++You got any better ideas?
Generic+++$+++You goin' to the escort service?
Generic+++$+++Stay here.
Generic+++$+++My folks are.
Generic+++$+++You're Polish?
Generic+++$+++My parents are from Poland.  I can help with the Eastern European angle.
Generic+++$+++This isn't homicide school.
Generic+++$+++I can watch you
Generic+++$+++There wasn't a fire.  There'll be nothing for you to do.
Generic+++$+++I'll come with you.
Generic+++$+++Or Czechoslovakia.  The Slavs have been fighting the Germans and the Russians for a thousand years.  These are very intense people and they take things personally.
Generic+++$+++Eastern Europe.  Like what?  Romania? Hungary?
Generic+++$+++Maybe it's a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message.  Burial rites are taken very seriously in Eastern Europe.  It could be to humiliate them. Just burning them up
Generic+++$+++What would you call her?
Generic+++$+++Who says she's a suspect?
Generic+++$+++Maybe you don't care about that either.  Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.
Generic+++$+++The Super said he'd seen her before but she didn't live here.
Generic+++$+++You were right
Generic+++$+++If you found me steppin' on your crime scene - it might piss you off
Generic+++$+++Sure.  But I would like to ask you something.  You got a problem with me?
Generic+++$+++Did you get a report from the M.E.?
Generic+++$+++Good.  Good.  Commendable.
Generic+++$+++I don't even watch TV.
Generic+++$+++Watch the news?
Generic+++$+++It's your crime scene now.  You can do what you want.
Generic+++$+++Why don't you explain it
Generic+++$+++You know what that is
Generic+++$+++Smarter than Americans.  You're fed cry baby talk shows all day long.  Not only will Americans believe me
Generic+++$+++You really think you'll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit?  How fuckin' stupid are you?
Generic+++$+++If you kill me and film it you're putting a noose around your neck.
Generic+++$+++So tabloids don't have to do re enactments.  They going to have real movie this time.
Generic+++$+++Good - be tough to the end.  Actor who plays you will want to die like hero.
Generic+++$+++Then do it
Generic+++$+++I kill someone famous.
Generic+++$+++What's your accomplishment.
Generic+++$+++Your opinion.  You see
Generic+++$+++What do you want?
Generic+++$+++So...who's Nicky?
Generic+++$+++Don't be late.
Generic+++$+++Thank you.
Generic+++$+++See you later.  Good luck.
Generic+++$+++Okay.  And you know what
Generic+++$+++Yeah.  I promise.
Generic+++$+++You promise?
Generic+++$+++I love you.
Generic+++$+++Patronizing you... Nay
Generic+++$+++Yeah.  I'll do that.  As long as you're not patronizing me.
Generic+++$+++I promise.  We'll talk.  You'll be great.  You'll be fine.  Go ahead
Generic+++$+++I'll tell you tonight.  Let's do it tonight.  As soon as you get back we'll talk.  We'll talk.
Generic+++$+++No.  No
Generic+++$+++No.  Go ahead.  You're gonna be great.
Generic+++$+++Okay.  That is great.  But I can't go now
Generic+++$+++That's good.
Generic+++$+++Oh my G-d
Generic+++$+++Okay.  Okay.  Hold that thought just for a second.  They only call me when it's an emergency.  Just hold that thought.  Can you call back?
Generic+++$+++Answer it.
Generic+++$+++No.  Tell me what you want to say.
Generic+++$+++Answer the phone.
Generic+++$+++Don't worry about the damn phone.  I won't answer it.
Generic+++$+++Jesus.  And last week you came over with blood on your shoes.  What am I going to do with you?
Generic+++$+++Could be Leon's.
Generic+++$+++Look at this.  You have blood on your shirt.  Whose is it?
Generic+++$+++You're not so bad yourself.
Generic+++$+++You're ruthless.
Generic+++$+++You were merciless.  You didn't give a shit if you got me or not.
Generic+++$+++That was good.  You were holding the evidence.
Generic+++$+++Yes you are.  I'm not just some reporter.  I don't just stick a microphone in your face.  You could give me something.
Generic+++$+++I'm not.
Generic+++$+++Maybe I should just
Generic+++$+++Stop it.
Generic+++$+++You didn't have to embarrass me in front of my colleagues.  You could give me something.
Generic+++$+++I can't...I can't answer you just because you want me to answer you!
Generic+++$+++What is your problem?  Why'd you snap at me?  I just wanted a statement.
Generic+++$+++Yeah.  Now's not a good time.
Generic+++$+++Um...now is not a good time
Generic+++$+++Do you have the suspect in custody?
Generic+++$+++He was hurt
Generic+++$+++Okay.  But I do understand that your partner
Generic+++$+++I really can't give out any information right now at this point.
Generic+++$+++I understand
Generic+++$+++I can't talk right now.  We have some things to take care of.
Generic+++$+++Detective - can you tell us what happened here?
Generic+++$+++We don't know.  When I have more I'll let you know.
Generic+++$+++Is it drug related?
Generic+++$+++You know you can't do that.  C'mon.
Generic+++$+++Can we go up to the crime scene?
Generic+++$+++There are two bodies found at this point.
Generic+++$+++How many victims are up there?
Generic+++$+++We don't know that yet.  It's much too early.  There's a lot to be done.
Generic+++$+++Again?  I didn't wanna do it the first time.
Generic+++$+++Any chance we can do that again?
Generic+++$+++Okay.  You ready?
Generic+++$+++Keep them out of my way.
Generic+++$+++You're worried for my safety.  I'm touched.
Generic+++$+++I hope this prick doesn't run.  My knees are killing me.  Stay behind me.
Generic+++$+++Yeah.  And he still went to the party.
Generic+++$+++That's unique.
Generic+++$+++He's from Antigua.  His girlfriend was taking too long to put her make-up on. they were late for a party.  Stabbed her with a beer bottle.
Generic+++$+++Not what.  Who.
Generic+++$+++So what's unique?
Generic+++$+++My kids?  Let's see...Susan's 15. Aundrea's 9.  Don't tell me you're thinking about having a kid!  How old are you?  Never mind. Let me just tell you this: Every stupid cliche you hear about kids - they change your life
Generic+++$+++How old are your kids?
Generic+++$+++I'm not moody.
Generic+++$+++I think you're getting a little moody there
Generic+++$+++Not chopped up.  Not chopped up like that.  I mean
Generic+++$+++Sooner or later that's everybody.
Generic+++$+++Jesus Christ.
Generic+++$+++So we're waitin' to hit this warrant - we got Emergency Service with the heavy weapons standin' by - ready to go.  I say
Generic+++$+++No.  Are you proposing?
Generic+++$+++Are you married?
Generic+++$+++Dog food.
Generic+++$+++And what do you do with the bones?
Generic+++$+++You stuff sausage in it.
Generic+++$+++You're a butcher?  What do you use pig intestines for?
Generic+++$+++I am butcher.
Generic+++$+++Okay.  You work in a vodka factory.  I understand that.  And what kind of work do you do?
Generic+++$+++Come alone.  Bring cash.  And we'll talk about surrendering.
Generic+++$+++Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.
Generic+++$+++If you don't want my film - I'll call another show.  And they will show it.
Generic+++$+++What?  It doesn't work that way.
Generic+++$+++We'll talk about that.  Four o'clock gives you time to go to bank.  Three hundred thousand dollars.
Generic+++$+++I'll meet you on one condition - I get exclusivity and you surrender to me.
Generic+++$+++No.  I'm the best that's ever threatened you.
Generic+++$+++Look asshole.  I've been threatened by better than you.
Generic+++$+++Come to 45 Broadway.  Don't bring the Police.  Come alone or you'll be in my next film.
Generic+++$+++If he doesn't lower his gun I'll fucking kill her.
Generic+++$+++Let her go!  Let her go!!
Generic+++$+++Tell him to put his gun down!
Generic+++$+++The Sheraton!  On Broadway!  Room 210. Go get Oleg.  He'll kill you.
Generic+++$+++Where's your partner?
Generic+++$+++Get down on your knees.
Generic+++$+++C'mon.  Pull the trigger.  Do it.  Oh
Generic+++$+++You'll be my first.
Generic+++$+++You can't kill me.  You're not a cop. Just fireman with a gun.  I bet you never shot anybody in your life.
Generic+++$+++My father was.  He gave me many lessons about fire.  Now it's my friend.
Generic+++$+++Were you a fireman?  That how you knew how to rig the apartment?
Generic+++$+++Give me the address!!
Generic+++$+++Listen to me.  I don't want sex.  Just give me the address and then you go.
Generic+++$+++Look.  Do we have a problem here? There's no reason to have a problem. I'm gonna make you feel real good.  You wanna Czech girl? After I'm done with you
Generic+++$+++I like to talk to the person who runs the service.  Can you give me address?
Generic+++$+++That's confidential.  Could you put the money on the dresser?
Generic+++$+++Where is escort service?
Generic+++$+++It's an outcall service run out of an apartment.  I don't meet the other girls.  Aren't you gonna get undressed?
Generic+++$+++I ordered a Czech girl.  Daphne
Generic+++$+++Now I like to get business out of the way before we get down to pleasure.  Why don'tchya put my money on the dresser.
Generic+++$+++Where's Czech girl?
Generic+++$+++He doesn't speak English.
Generic+++$+++I'd like to speak for himself
Generic+++$+++Two weeks.
Generic+++$+++How long are you planning to stay?
Generic+++$+++We are both from Prague.
Generic+++$+++Is there a problem?
Generic+++$+++Please join us.  Come on forward.
Generic+++$+++Is he with you?  Are you travelling together?
Generic+++$+++Can you show me?  Sir
Generic+++$+++I have five-hundred dollars.
Generic+++$+++How much money are you carrying with you?
Generic+++$+++Two weeks holiday.
Generic+++$+++What is your intended purpose of your visit to the United States?
Generic+++$+++Yes sir.
Generic+++$+++Next.  Could I see your documents
Generic+++$+++Yes.  Both.
Generic+++$+++Million?!  The killer gets one million dollars for a television interview?
Generic+++$+++In here
Generic+++$+++Do you know how much killer gets for movie rights?
Generic+++$+++This all you want?
Generic+++$+++New York's finest.  This is his case.
Generic+++$+++Who is he?
Generic+++$+++No.  You are the traitor.  You are murderer.  I am director.  Action!
Generic+++$+++You think you are a director?  You are a fucking little
Generic+++$+++You got that?
Generic+++$+++Yes.  But there's only one problem - you want credit but the problem is - I don't share credit.
Generic+++$+++Yes.  Before we hand in the next video - I put titles on it and my credit is going to read - Directed by Oleg Razgul.
Generic+++$+++I'm serious...this - this is a great American film.  Full of violence and sex.  And I want my credit.
Generic+++$+++Your idea?  I thought it was my idea.
Generic+++$+++Because I am the director.  Don't you realize
Generic+++$+++Why did you leave that stuff in about you being the director?
Generic+++$+++Be quiet.  Watch.
Generic+++$+++I told you to cut that out before we handed in the tape!
Generic+++$+++Bad last moment - I cut it out.
Generic+++$+++This is my project.  I say 'action.'  I am the director!  You are the talent. You wait for me to say 'action.'  And 'action!'
Generic+++$+++Shut up.  Look!
Generic+++$+++I'm serious.
Generic+++$+++The one who got caught in the bathroom.  George Michael.
Generic+++$+++In movie they make of us
Generic+++$+++You are success story?  I am success story!  Why do you say I and not we?
Generic+++$+++Okay.  He has nothing to say.  Start the camera!
Generic+++$+++Good idea!
Generic+++$+++No.  We are insane.  Who else but crazy men would film their murders?  So we kill someone famous and if we are caught
Generic+++$+++This way.  Hold it this way.  Good.
Generic+++$+++Sit down!
Generic+++$+++Let me get a shot of it.
Generic+++$+++What does it look like?  It's an address book!
Generic+++$+++What is that?
Generic+++$+++Put the camera down
Generic+++$+++Why not?
Generic+++$+++And the whore's murder?  You didn't erase that either
Generic+++$+++I did.
Generic+++$+++The video of Milos and Tamina - I told you to erase it.
Generic+++$+++What is it?
Generic+++$+++Don't want to film this?
Generic+++$+++Does it hurt?
Generic+++$+++Shut up.
Generic+++$+++Gotta light the scene better.  Now it's more moody... like a scene from THE THIRD MAN.
Generic+++$+++Whatever we do - we fuck her
Generic+++$+++Get in the bathroom!
Generic+++$+++I'm homesick.  You have Eastern European girl?  A Czech girl?
Generic+++$+++I'll do it.  Don't hurt my camera!
Generic+++$+++How you erase this?
Generic+++$+++You said speak Czech!
Generic+++$+++Speak English!
Generic+++$+++I'm not filming.  I'm watching Milos die.  It's just like a move but realer.
Generic+++$+++Turn that fucking thing off!
Generic+++$+++Smell like chemicals...for smoking drugs.
Generic+++$+++For five years I paid for your stupidness - you'll carry my bag for the rest of my life if I say so.  Unless you refuse
Generic+++$+++Why should I carry your bag?  I am not a dog.
Generic+++$+++Turn that off!  Get the bags.
Generic+++$+++We have no money.  Come on.
Generic+++$+++Look.  New videocameras.  Color viewfinder.  Image stabilization. Solarization.  Night vision.
Generic+++$+++Because I don't like your ugly language. I heard enough of it in school!  Now speak Czech or English.  And don't fool around anymore.  You almost got us thrown out!
Generic+++$+++Why?  Why do I always have to speak to you in Czech?
Generic+++$+++Don't speak Russian!
Generic+++$+++Look.  Times Square.  Just like in the movies!
Generic+++$+++I want to document my trip to America.
Generic+++$+++Did you hear what I said?
Generic+++$+++Don't fool around.
Generic+++$+++Just do what I do.  Say the same thing I say.  Don't open your mouth.
Generic+++$+++You spent all the money while I was in prison?  Now you tell me to get a job fixing toilets?!?
Generic+++$+++We started over
Generic+++$+++A job??  As a plumber???  You think I come to America to work!
Generic+++$+++It's easy to learn.
Generic+++$+++As a plumber?!
Generic+++$+++A job?
Generic+++$+++I can get you a job.
Generic+++$+++Look at the way we live.  I'm a plumber. You think I'd be working if I had money?!
Generic+++$+++Ha. Ha.
Generic+++$+++We spent it!
Generic+++$+++Milos.  Get my money!
Generic+++$+++Take your eyes off her
Generic+++$+++You know me...I never hurt anybody. Where's the money?
Generic+++$+++Did you hurt her?
Generic+++$+++Your sister said she didn't know where you were so you shouldn't write to her with return address if you're hiding.
Generic+++$+++Surprise!  Surprise!
Generic+++$+++You want the tape?  There it is!
Generic+++$+++Viewer discretion advised!
Generic+++$+++Trust me
Generic+++$+++I can't talk to anybody right now
Generic+++$+++You've got a call.
Generic+++$+++What are you doing here?
Generic+++$+++Don't give me that fucking shit.
Generic+++$+++If I didn't put it on somebody else would!  I was his friend!
Generic+++$+++You outta be ashamed.  Ashamed of yourself.
Generic+++$+++This footage will work in your favor. When the jury sees this - no matter what Cutler tries
Generic+++$+++And you
Generic+++$+++In love?  With who?
Generic+++$+++Of course he's moody.  He thinks he's in love.
Generic+++$+++Isn't he a little moody?
Generic+++$+++Oh my G-d.  We were having lunch here. He started making overtures - talking about little shoes next to his in his closet but I got a call to anchor - and I walked out on him.  I walked out on him when he was trying to ask me to marry him!!
Generic+++$+++That morning.  He was talking to me and Leon about marriage.
Generic+++$+++Alright.  Go ahead.
Generic+++$+++I'm trying to tell you.
Generic+++$+++I want to hear everything he said.
Generic+++$+++What do you mean you know?  He told you he was gonna propose to me?
Generic+++$+++I know.
Generic+++$+++Excuse me?
Generic+++$+++Yes.  No.  Both.  When I was a boy
Generic+++$+++Movies...to be in the movies or to see movies?
Generic+++$+++I'm here for movies.
Generic+++$+++What are you coming here to do?
Generic+++$+++A cheap hotel.
Generic+++$+++New York.
Generic+++$+++Then answer my questions.  Where were you planning to stay during the two weeks that you're here?
Generic+++$+++I speak English.
Generic+++$+++Okay.  You're a Czech national and you're a Russian national.  How do you know one another?
Generic+++$+++Yes...he's my friend.
Generic+++$+++He's yours but I take him in!  I'll drive him to the precinct
Generic+++$+++He's my collar!
Generic+++$+++We're takin' him.  Don't argue!
Generic+++$+++No way!  He's mine!
Generic+++$+++I'll take him.
Generic+++$+++Evidence.  Of a homicide.
Generic+++$+++What was that?
Generic+++$+++And while they're burning up
Generic+++$+++That's what it looks like to me.
Generic+++$+++So the way you see it
Generic+++$+++Thanks.  Appreciate it.
Generic+++$+++No.  Go ahead.
Generic+++$+++Your civil rights?!  You tried to rob me!  I could arrest you right now! You're lucky you're walking away from this.  Now get outta here.
Generic+++$+++A dog pissed on me!!  I'm gonna sue you for this!  You violated my civil rights!
Generic+++$+++You okay?
Generic+++$+++Hey.  C'mon
Generic+++$+++I'll send a cop back for you.
Generic+++$+++Oh yeah?  Guess again.
Generic+++$+++Fire Department?  Firemen don't carry guns.
Generic+++$+++Got any spare change?  How 'bout a spare twenty?
Generic+++$+++Yeah?  What kind?
Generic+++$+++I used an accelerant.
Generic+++$+++How did you start the fire this time?
Generic+++$+++What's that on your forehead
Generic+++$+++They were inside.  They booby trapped her apartment!
Generic+++$+++What the hell happened?
Generic+++$+++Get outta here!
Generic+++$+++Not good.
Generic+++$+++How was it?
Generic+++$+++Lay down.  Stay down
Generic+++$+++It hurts.  Aw
Generic+++$+++If I go home I won't be able to fall asleep anyway.
Generic+++$+++Aren't you tired?
Generic+++$+++You go home.  I'm takin' your car and goin' back to the crime scene.
Generic+++$+++You hear that question
Generic+++$+++How long they been livin' here?
Generic+++$+++-- From Czechoslovakia?  And how long have they been livin' in your building?  Alright
Generic+++$+++Maybe you can be his stand-in.
Generic+++$+++Now that you know him
Generic+++$+++There was a woman - I think she wanted to talk to us.  She looked scared.  Oh shit!  Oh no!
Generic+++$+++That's why he was so quiet.  He was testing us.
Generic+++$+++He knew all along.
Generic+++$+++You see Eddie's face when I gave him the timer?  Wish I had a picture of it.
Generic+++$+++But you knew that
Generic+++$+++The smoke'll permeate your nostrils - burn 'em out.  Let it run.
Generic+++$+++Don't blow your nose!
Generic+++$+++Mouth's clean
Generic+++$+++Could you put out the cigar?  Part of the job is picking up scents.
Generic+++$+++'Cause Eddie woulda locked him up by now!
Generic+++$+++Oh yeah
Generic+++$+++Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.
Generic+++$+++You see anything in the crowd?  Anybody suspicious?
Generic+++$+++I don't know
Generic+++$+++I heard.  Who the hell let them up there?
Generic+++$+++Where you been
Generic+++$+++GET OUTTA HERE NOW!!  GET IN THAT CAR AND DRIVE AWAY!!!  DO WHAT I SAY OR I'LL KILL YOU
Generic+++$+++Take the car.  Get outta here
Generic+++$+++Don't stoop to his level!
Generic+++$+++Don't you get it?  He knew he was gonna get caught!  That's why he videotaped Eddie's murder - he thinks he's gonna get off.
Generic+++$+++What are you gonna do?
Generic+++$+++The clerk?
Generic+++$+++Capra?  That's not Czech or Russian. Who said he sounded Russian?
Generic+++$+++Room was registered to a Francis Capra.
Generic+++$+++That doesn't apply to me because I'm not a criminal.  I'm not a criminal!  I wasn't convicted.
Generic+++$+++But doesn't the Son of Sam Law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes?
Generic+++$+++We're in negotiations
Generic+++$+++And isn't there a movie in the works about you?
Generic+++$+++Permanently disrupted?  Aren't you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money?  Hasn't this 'incident' as you call it
Generic+++$+++You seem very savvy for a man who's been found mentally incompetent to stand trial.
Generic+++$+++It was my finger that pulled the trigger
Generic+++$+++...so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people?
Generic+++$+++Yes.  My psychiatrist didn't insist that I stay on my medication.
Generic+++$+++Your doctor?
Generic+++$+++This had nothing to do with shoes that didn't fit or my relationship with my father who
Generic+++$+++We're trying to get there. I hope we can.
Generic+++$+++I'm sorry
Generic+++$+++How did they manage to do that without any communication?
Generic+++$+++She's wonderful.
Generic+++$+++I'm afraid I've only got a few minutes
Generic+++$+++SPACE STATTION 5 - LOUNGE
Generic+++$+++I think I'll have to go out and burn them off.
Generic+++$+++I guess not.
Generic+++$+++I guess you don't know your own strength
Generic+++$+++I didn't do that Frank. I took particular care not to freeze them.
Generic+++$+++It's the last one.
Generic+++$+++Two more.
Generic+++$+++Two units in four days. How many spares do we have?
Generic+++$+++I don't know. Hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure.
Generic+++$+++You're kidding.
Generic+++$+++Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again.
Generic+++$+++Are you reasonably awake?
Generic+++$+++Good morning. How's it going?
Generic+++$+++I suppose computers have been known to be wrong.
Generic+++$+++I guess it isn't.
Generic+++$+++I suppose it isn't logically impossible.
Generic+++$+++But not completely inconceivable?
Generic+++$+++I know. It would be almost inconceivable.
Generic+++$+++Not really. Though
Generic+++$+++That's true.
Generic+++$+++Just ask Hal. It's conceivable they might keep something from us
Generic+++$+++Of course
Generic+++$+++That seems very unlikely.
Generic+++$+++I don't know. All I heard is that there's something about the mission we weren't told.
Generic+++$+++Yes. You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out.
Generic+++$+++I suppose so. Though
Generic+++$+++I suppose the idea was specialized training.
Generic+++$+++No. I never did
Generic+++$+++I must say
Generic+++$+++I don't think we should make any fuss about it yet. I'm sure they'll straighten it out.
Generic+++$+++It's possible.
Generic+++$+++Not really. They just said it might be because we trained at Houston and they trained in Marshall
Generic+++$+++Interesting that you mention it
Generic+++$+++That's right. Well
Generic+++$+++Well I got the papers on my official up-grading to AGS-19 two weeks before we left.
Generic+++$+++It's about my salary cheques.
Generic+++$+++What's up?
Generic+++$+++Okay.
Generic+++$+++Right. Just a sec.
Generic+++$+++Hi. Frank... coming in
Generic+++$+++Listen to me very carefully
Generic+++$+++I know that you've had that on your mind for some time now
Generic+++$+++I am prepared to do that anyway.
Generic+++$+++I'm sorry
Generic+++$+++I can tell from the tone of your voice
Generic+++$+++I don't like to assert myself
Generic+++$+++I'm goin to do this myself
Generic+++$+++If you're determined to revive the crew now
Generic+++$+++I don't really agree with you
Generic+++$+++It doesn't have to be
Generic+++$+++Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.
Generic+++$+++The antenna has to be replaced.
Generic+++$+++I suppose it's because you've been under a lot of stress
Generic+++$+++I suppose you're pretty broken up about it?
Generic+++$+++Too bad about Frank
Generic+++$+++Is your confidence in me fully restored?
Generic+++$+++And don't you worry about it.
Generic+++$+++I'm sorry about the misunderstanding
Generic+++$+++I'm not questioning your word
Generic+++$+++You probably also know that we found them okay.
Generic+++$+++You know that we checked the two AO-units that you reported in imminent failure condition?
Generic+++$+++Not now
Generic+++$+++I understand Hal. We'll take care of it. Please
Generic+++$+++The unit is still operational
Generic+++$+++MY F.P.C. shows an impending failure of the antenna orientation unit.
Generic+++$+++What is it
Generic+++$+++Sorry to interrupt the festivities
Generic+++$+++He's got a point.
Generic+++$+++I'm sorry
Generic+++$+++Well... it's silly
Generic+++$+++Did they have any explanation for this?
Generic+++$+++I'll wish you a happy Birthday now and I'll see you soon. All right
Generic+++$+++Thank you
Generic+++$+++How many days until you come home?
Generic+++$+++She's in the bathroom.
Generic+++$+++Where is Mrs. Brown?
Generic+++$+++Mommy's out to the hair- dresser.
Generic+++$+++In three days
Generic+++$+++When are you coming home?
Generic+++$+++Are you coming to my party?
Generic+++$+++I'm having a party tomorrow.
Generic+++$+++I'm fine
Generic+++$+++I'm at Space Station Five
Generic+++$+++I'll bet it's a fortune.
Generic+++$+++I was working out what this trip must cost
Generic+++$+++Berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning Mars flight.
Generic+++$+++I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later.
Generic+++$+++Thank you.
Generic+++$+++Thank you. It's been a great pleasure to meet all of you... Dr. Smyslov.
Generic+++$+++Are you sure you won't change your mind about a drink?
Generic+++$+++Clavius Control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal.
Generic+++$+++He's fine. But I'm afraid we don't get a chance to see each other very much these days.
Generic+++$+++How is gregor?
Generic+++$+++And your charming little daughter?
Generic+++$+++I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking.
Generic+++$+++Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?
Generic+++$+++I'm terribly sorry. I was just on my way down to meet you. I saw your ship dock and I knew I had plenty of time
Generic+++$+++How do you do
Generic+++$+++Dr. Smyslov... I'm not permitted to discuss this.
Generic+++$+++This epidemic could easily spread to our base
Generic+++$+++Quite frankly
Generic+++$+++Dr. Floyd
Generic+++$+++Yes... Well
Generic+++$+++I see.
Generic+++$+++That's right.
Generic+++$+++You mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days?
Generic+++$+++Yes. Well
Generic+++$+++I'm sorry
Generic+++$+++Are you
Generic+++$+++Are you quite sure?
Generic+++$+++I don't think it has
Generic+++$+++Has it been exposed to any sun before now?
Generic+++$+++Any ideas about the colour?
Generic+++$+++But you don't have any idea as to what it is?
Generic+++$+++Not really. It's completely inert. No sound or energy sources have been detected. The surface is made of something incredibly hard and we've been barely able to scratch it. A laser drill
Generic+++$+++Any clue as to what it is?
Generic+++$+++By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill.
Generic+++$+++How can you tell it was deliberately buried?
Generic+++$+++I'm afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the Council. And of course you know that the Council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every- one who had any knowledge of this event. There must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con- sideration can be given to making a public announcement.
Generic+++$+++Dr. Floyd
Generic+++$+++I see. Well
Generic+++$+++I take it this is something to do with the trouble they're having up at Clavius?
Generic+++$+++I see.
Generic+++$+++Well... the crew is confined to the ship when we land at Clavius. We have to stay inside for the time it take to refit - about twenty-four hours. And then we're going to back empty.
Generic+++$+++What do you mean?
Generic+++$+++Thank you.
Generic+++$+++We're scheduled to dock in about seven hours. Is there anything we can do for you?
Generic+++$+++When do we arrive at Clavius?
Generic+++$+++There's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest.
Generic+++$+++All right
Generic+++$+++Not really
Generic+++$+++Do you have any idea of what is causing this fault?
Generic+++$+++Let me see the tracking alignment display.
Generic+++$+++I know you did
Generic+++$+++It looks like we have another bad A.O. unit. My FPC shows another impending failure.
Generic+++$+++Opening pod bay doors.
Generic+++$+++Pod Bay is decompressed. All doors are secure. You are free to open pod bay doors.
Generic+++$+++I understand.
Generic+++$+++Five by five
Generic+++$+++Thank you very much
Generic+++$+++That's true.
Generic+++$+++There is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program
Generic+++$+++That's true
Generic+++$+++Approximately five years after we go into hibernation
Generic+++$+++That's true.
Generic+++$+++That's true.
Generic+++$+++Our transit time is 257 days. Is that true?
Generic+++$+++Our Mission Profile calls for Discovery going to Saturn. True or false?
Generic+++$+++I will if I can
Generic+++$+++Right. Hal
Generic+++$+++That we do. And we put air in the tires. I'll even sell you some gas if you need it.
Generic+++$+++How about chargin' the battery?
Generic+++$+++We don't wash 'em
Generic+++$+++This is three years old.
Generic+++$+++I want to pick up my car.
Generic+++$+++Try obeyin' the law once in awhile
Generic+++$+++I'm tellin' ya
Generic+++$+++I don't give a damn about his girl...
Generic+++$+++I don't give a shit who you ask.
Generic+++$+++Maybe I better ask around
Generic+++$+++Fuck off.  I don't know what the hell you're talkin' about.
Generic+++$+++Now how's your memory doin'?
Generic+++$+++Maybe you better have a Black Russian.
Generic+++$+++And I need one more for my pal. Yeah. Make her an Indian. No
Generic+++$+++He's just kiddin'
Generic+++$+++Maybe that's where I'm gonna cut your throat.
Generic+++$+++Just do what I say
Generic+++$+++They always let me do anything. I don't want to pay for it.  I never paid for it in my life.
Generic+++$+++It's better when you pay... they let you do anything.
Generic+++$+++I never paid for it in my life.
Generic+++$+++Pay money?
Generic+++$+++Whaddya mean
Generic+++$+++Maybe after we get done with him I'm gonna buy us some girls.
Generic+++$+++I ain't tired yet.
Generic+++$+++I want to drive awhile.
Generic+++$+++You got a real big mouth
Generic+++$+++Maybe you shoulda stole a better truck
Generic+++$+++Now you're talkin'. See ya...
Generic+++$+++I'll buy ya the best dinner in San Francisco...how'd that be? Then we'll go dancin'
Generic+++$+++Here you go
Generic+++$+++I just struck it rich... I think we can do a little business.  As a matter of fact
Generic+++$+++Here's hoping
Generic+++$+++What's the matter with my place?
Generic+++$+++You just quit bein' a priest or somethin'?
Generic+++$+++You're in a hurry.
Generic+++$+++Here you go sweetheart
Generic+++$+++Oh ... You're a schoolteacher...
Generic+++$+++Excuse me
Generic+++$+++I'm candy...
Generic+++$+++In the back.  Down the other corridor.
Generic+++$+++Where's ganz?
Generic+++$+++He can live or die ... You let us in and he's got a chance to make it.  Otherwise
Generic+++$+++No chance.
Generic+++$+++You're gonna help us take him.
Generic+++$+++Yeah.  Sure
Generic+++$+++You and the other one
Generic+++$+++No time for any of that crap any more
Generic+++$+++Would you guys...
Generic+++$+++I hear you've got visitors.
Generic+++$+++I used to go with him...I don't know where the hell he is.  I haven't seen him for two weeks. And I don't think I will.  He owes me money...
Generic+++$+++How about it?
Generic+++$+++Don't give me that police shit. You drop it.
Generic+++$+++I said police.  Now drop the goddamn gun.
Generic+++$+++I ain't gonna beg for my life. It ain't cool.
Generic+++$+++You're done.  End of story.
Generic+++$+++I got hit.  I can't believe it. I got shot.
Generic+++$+++Whaddya mean...I got your gun ... I got his money... I got everything...
Generic+++$+++I don't think you're gonna make it.
Generic+++$+++After I get outta this
Generic+++$+++What are you talking about? We didn't kill her ...
Generic+++$+++You lying son of a bitch...
Generic+++$+++No trouble
Generic+++$+++Spare met Jack. I'm into legit investments from here on in.
Generic+++$+++You are an awesomely weird cop. Sure wish there were more like you runnin' around out here.
Generic+++$+++That's right. Not my style
Generic+++$+++And you're tellin' me you don't want any of this cash?
Generic+++$+++It's your money.  It'll be here in six months when you get out.
Generic+++$+++There's nothin' to talk about.
Generic+++$+++Wait a minute
Generic+++$+++You did pick a real strange time to go and be brave all on your own...
Generic+++$+++Yeah.  But I wasn't there for a second.
Generic+++$+++You okay?
Generic+++$+++If we run into Billy first
Generic+++$+++Whatever play I maker just back me up.
Generic+++$+++I've got to play it rough with them. If they know anything
Generic+++$+++What if your girl's theory turns out to be bullshit?  I mean
Generic+++$+++If she's right
Generic+++$+++Do I get to kiss her too?
Generic+++$+++Don't worry about it.
Generic+++$+++It's late
Generic+++$+++Sorry we didn't do better
Generic+++$+++I don't know about you
Generic+++$+++Back to jail in my own car.  Ganz got away. Got all my money. It just don't seem right.
Generic+++$+++I had it impounded.  Come on
Generic+++$+++Yeah. It missed the last four stops.
Generic+++$+++Notice something funny about that bus?
Generic+++$+++Luther's on the move...
Generic+++$+++When you been in prison three years
Generic+++$+++That was quick.
Generic+++$+++I can just take her right across the street to Luther's hotel.  All I need is some money for the room.
Generic+++$+++Yeah. Guess not.
Generic+++$+++Bein' good at your job don't explain everything
Generic+++$+++Thanks for callin' in... and I guess Maybe... Look
Generic+++$+++You sure that's the reason?
Generic+++$+++I don't know why
Generic+++$+++Forget it. I want Ganz as bad as you do and I got some other news for you...
Generic+++$+++Tell me something.  Why didn't you just take the money off Luther and split?
Generic+++$+++So you took the rest of the night off...
Generic+++$+++They must have set up a meeting for the morning; Luther left an 8 am wake-up and put up the "Don't Disturb" sign.  He's trading his girl for the money.  All we have to do to grab Ganz is not go blind.
Generic+++$+++Let him get some sleep.  He's going to need it.
Generic+++$+++Maybe we should pay Luther a visit.
Generic+++$+++You missed ... Luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street. Made a phone call.
Generic+++$+++We missed.
Generic+++$+++What about Ganz?
Generic+++$+++What about Luther?
Generic+++$+++Hello. And goodbye.
Generic+++$+++Be polite. Say hello.  This is Candy.
Generic+++$+++Where's luther?
Generic+++$+++I'll be there in a minute. You don't move your ass
Generic+++$+++No way...
Generic+++$+++You stay with me...
Generic+++$+++Bullshit. Then i'm staying with the money.
Generic+++$+++Right. if you ever switch from armed robbery to pimping
Generic+++$+++That was in style a couple years back
Generic+++$+++We're getting too close ... Cates
Generic+++$+++Class isn't somethin' you buy
Generic+++$+++No class...
Generic+++$+++What you don't understand is
Generic+++$+++You know
Generic+++$+++A long time agb Luther must of got the shit beat out of him so bad it just rattled his brain ... that would account for him making so many wrong moves in a row...
Generic+++$+++If he's hoping that then he's dumber than I think he is
Generic+++$+++Maybe Luther hopes Ganz'll give him a piece of your money...
Generic+++$+++You got a very depressing view of life
Generic+++$+++I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-...
Generic+++$+++Doesn't it get... Tiring?
Generic+++$+++If they don't tell me what I need to know...
Generic+++$+++That ain't philosophy.  That's common sense.
Generic+++$+++I let women get to me.  The quest for pussy is the meaning of life ... I got my own personal philosophy about 'em.  Keep women separate from guns
Generic+++$+++I suppose you'd never be like Luther and let a woman get to you...
Generic+++$+++I'm tellin' you the man's in love... he wants to be a hero for his girl.
Generic+++$+++If I was his size and had Ganz on my ass
Generic+++$+++Tryin' to save his girl
Generic+++$+++You'd think the guy'd be smart enough to know he was being tailed.
Generic+++$+++I had no choice. Some white asshole bought the last piece of shit skyblue Cadillac.
Generic+++$+++Didn't know you darker people went in for foreign jobs.
Generic+++$+++Jesus Christ
Generic+++$+++Jesus Christ.  That's a disgrace The guy pulls a gun on a cop and he's out in 24 hours.  I tell you some of the courts these days are just a fucking revolving door.
Generic+++$+++Musta got some primo bondsman.
Generic+++$+++Guess what?  Luther just got in line.
Generic+++$+++Not really.  I figured Ganz was put down for a long time.  And I knew Luther would never job me on his own.  He's too chickenshit.
Generic+++$+++You took a big chance
Generic+++$+++I wasn't sure the money was still there until we saw Luther. You almost got your ass shot off for nothing once
Generic+++$+++You son of a bitch. You knew where the money was all along and all we had to do was come here and wait. I almost got my ass blown off twice tonight for nothing.
Generic+++$+++You just drove by it.
Generic+++$+++...For three years?  Let's hope it wasn't a tow-away zone.
Generic+++$+++This'll show you how smart I am. I got it parked.
Generic+++$+++You're a real case
Generic+++$+++Where's the goddamn car?
Generic+++$+++Yeah.  Right.
Generic+++$+++Get this. We ain't partners. We ain't brothers. We ain't friends. If Ganz gets away with my money
Generic+++$+++In the trunk of a car.  A lot better than under a mattress
Generic+++$+++Where's the money?
Generic+++$+++Depends on how things work out. I believe in the merit system. So far you haven't built up any points.
Generic+++$+++You gonna let me keep any of it?
Generic+++$+++Not likely
Generic+++$+++We split 50-50?
Generic+++$+++You catch on real fast...Okay
Generic+++$+++He's after your money.
Generic+++$+++Me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale. It's the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen. I was sittin' pretty
Generic+++$+++Just tell me about the money.
Generic+++$+++Half a million.
Generic+++$+++How much?
Generic+++$+++I been waiting a long time for some money.
Generic+++$+++One thing's for sure
Generic+++$+++They saved your ass
Generic+++$+++Who gives a Goddamn what you think? You're just a crook that's got a weekendpass ... You're not even a name anymore. Just a spear- chucker with a Goddamn number stenciled on the back of his prison fatigues...
Generic+++$+++Maybe I don't like the way you ask.
Generic+++$+++Luther knew more than he told me and so do you...Now you better tell we what the fuck this is all about.  I gave you 48 hours to come up with something and the clock's runnin' ...
Generic+++$+++I'm impressed with you too
Generic+++$+++You?  Don't make me laugh.  You can't take care of shit.  You've been dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt.  All you're good for is games... So far
Generic+++$+++You wanna leave
Generic+++$+++This sucks.  A maniac gets hold of my gun and goes all over the streets killing people with it. So
Generic+++$+++Wait a minute.  Maybe these ladies would like to go a few laps with us.  How about it? I been nearly three years in prison and...
Generic+++$+++Let's go.
Generic+++$+++Come on.
Generic+++$+++Must be billy's girl.
Generic+++$+++While you're at it
Generic+++$+++You made that move
Generic+++$+++Some of us citizens are with you all the way
Generic+++$+++That wasn't necessary
Generic+++$+++My kind of place. I always liked country boys.
Generic+++$+++This place don't seem real popular with the brothers.
Generic+++$+++I thought you said bullshit and experience are all it takes.
Generic+++$+++I'm gonna enjoy this ... here
Generic+++$+++The bet's off.
Generic+++$+++I don't know what you're talking about. I just wanna see Ganz nailed.
Generic+++$+++You tell me what Ganz busted out for
Generic+++$+++What are you talkin' about?
Generic+++$+++I'll tell you what happens if you lose... you tell the truth for once.
Generic+++$+++That's never been one of my problems.
Generic+++$+++Why?  Anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably can't get it up anyway.
Generic+++$+++If we come outta this joint with Ganz' phone number
Generic+++$+++I got two problems.  Number one
Generic+++$+++You need five years training to handle a joint like...
Generic+++$+++I been in a lot of bars where a white cop rousted me and some of the brothers. All those clowns ever had going for 'em was a gun and a badge...
Generic+++$+++Bullshit.  Attitude and experience get you through...
Generic+++$+++But you can handle it all right
Generic+++$+++If they kick my ass
Generic+++$+++Back you up?  Now why would I wanna do that?
Generic+++$+++This part of town
Generic+++$+++It's a long shot
Generic+++$+++At least you took care of business and got the important part in before she came down on you...Tell me a little about her.  She got great tits?
Generic+++$+++Sure.  Then we had a fight this morning.
Generic+++$+++You have a good time?
Generic+++$+++Last night.
Generic+++$+++Last night
Generic+++$+++I don't give out the details.
Generic+++$+++Mission District.  Gonna find us an Indian.
Generic+++$+++She's got the same complaint as half the Goddamn population.  She can't get the job she's trained for and it pisses her off... Anyway
Generic+++$+++You really do have onoe
Generic+++$+++Just get in the car and keep your mouth shut.
Generic+++$+++Who'd you call on the phone back at the booking station?
Generic+++$+++Bullshit ... I ain't moving  till I get something to eat. You've been treating me like shit ever since I came out here.  If you don't like it
Generic+++$+++We eat when I say we eat.
Generic+++$+++Speakin' of moans my Stomach is startin' to growl.
Generic+++$+++Do you know how close I was to getting some trim.  And you fucked' it up.
Generic+++$+++We're on the move. Let's go. As they walk toward a corridor.
Generic+++$+++If you let him run around till Tuesday
Generic+++$+++He's gotta take that call ... if there is one.
Generic+++$+++I think you better put him on ice
Generic+++$+++What do you think?
Generic+++$+++Want to try it again?
Generic+++$+++Thank you.
Generic+++$+++Just throw me the Goddamn gun.
Generic+++$+++I got a whole thing about people pointin' guns at me.
Generic+++$+++I'm tellin' you to drop the Goddam gun.
Generic+++$+++Quit playin' cop and undo this cuff
Generic+++$+++I'm helpin' you
Generic+++$+++Luther ain't the reliable type. I don't want you shot yet
Generic+++$+++Your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me?
Generic+++$+++Just up the street
Generic+++$+++I may call you worse than that.
Generic+++$+++Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead....
Generic+++$+++I don't give a damn.  It happens to be my name.
Generic+++$+++Just an expression man
Generic+++$+++I can read a police file
Generic+++$+++What gang you talkin' about
Generic+++$+++Luther was part of the gang?
Generic+++$+++Don't worry
Generic+++$+++It looks like you bought it off one of the brothers.
Generic+++$+++Shit.  I'm already sorry.
Generic+++$+++Get this.  We ain't partners. We ain't brothers.  We ain't friends. I'm puttin' you down and keepin' you down until Ganz is locked up or dead.  And if Ganz gets away
Generic+++$+++No way to start a partnership.
Generic+++$+++You just don't get it
Generic+++$+++You got a girl... shit... the generosityof women never ceases to amaze me.
Generic+++$+++I don't need to hear your jive. I already got that department taken care of...
Generic+++$+++We're supposed to be after a killer
Generic+++$+++What are you talkin' about?  This suit's mine.  It cost $900.
Generic+++$+++This prison gives out $400 suits?
Generic+++$+++I'll think about it.
Generic+++$+++It's the only way you're gonna get Ganz.
Generic+++$+++I got a lot to protect.
Generic+++$+++What's the big deal about you bein' on the street?
Generic+++$+++I can help you
Generic+++$+++You're crazy.
Generic+++$+++I can deliver Ganz.  But you gotta get me outta here first.
Generic+++$+++Didn't work out that way.  He busted out with a big Indian. They capped two guards on a road gang. Nice meeting you Reggie.
Generic+++$+++Ganz is in jail.  He's gonna be there two years after I'm on the street.
Generic+++$+++Not likely
Generic+++$+++You here to write my life story?
Generic+++$+++Try Cates.  And let's talk in private
Generic+++$+++You got a name
Generic+++$+++I'm taking my prisoner back to jail.
Generic+++$+++Where the Christ do you think you're going?
Generic+++$+++Just cause you say it with conviction don't mean shit to me... How you gonna take to a pink slip
Generic+++$+++He's got more brains and more guts in one corner of his asshole than any cop I've worked with.
Generic+++$+++Too bad
Generic+++$+++I didn't have the time.
Generic+++$+++Don't duck the bullet Cates. Why didn't you call in for backup instead of makin' a grandstand play?
Generic+++$+++Right.  I screwed up.  I fucked up. I messed up.  Anybody could have done better
Generic+++$+++What a screw-up.
Generic+++$+++You couldn't get to him?
Generic+++$+++The Indian.  I was about 30 yards away.
Generic+++$+++Which one pulled the trigger?
Generic+++$+++They ran.  As fast as they could. Caught a train.
Generic+++$+++How did they get away?
Generic+++$+++I lost them
Generic+++$+++What the bell happened?
Generic+++$+++I'll keep it in mind.
Generic+++$+++Try not to get your ass shot to pieces. We got enough dead cops on this one.
Generic+++$+++You really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude. He starts to go.
Generic+++$+++Okay.  You're not a team player. You gotta do things your own way. Fine.  Nail this guy and make us all look good.  But you better watch your ass.  If you screw up
Generic+++$+++Being a hot dog's worked pretty well for me so far... Besides
Generic+++$+++You might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one
Generic+++$+++Yeah.  It bothers me when cops get hurt while I'm makin' a play. I don't like it.
Generic+++$+++Anthing botherin' you besides losin' your gun?
Generic+++$+++I want to be left alone on this one. Algren was killed with my gun.
Generic+++$+++I guess when two cops die on account of your fuck up you want to keep it as quiet as possible...
Generic+++$+++Are you gonna tell me about police procedure?  Do me a favor
Generic+++$+++Somebody steals your gun
Generic+++$+++The truth hurts
Generic+++$+++But that's what you say about all of us all the tine ... we're always the ones fucking up when you tell it...
Generic+++$+++That's what you say
Generic+++$+++I'm not paid to take your personal calls.  He was in some bar. .. off duty.
Generic+++$+++Jesus Christ.  Why the hell didn't you tell me before?
Generic+++$+++I almost forgot.  That pal of yours from the Vice Squad wants you to call him.
Generic+++$+++Okay.  See you in the morning... you know
Generic+++$+++I got to wait for a call.
Generic+++$+++I'm heading out. How about you?
Generic+++$+++Bullshit red tape.
Generic+++$+++Nothing came in for me yet?  No calls?
Generic+++$+++Doesn't look like it.
Generic+++$+++Long night
Generic+++$+++So do you...been a long day.
Generic+++$+++You look awful.
Generic+++$+++One of  em's in the slam.
Generic+++$+++Here's the file. Cates checks the file.
Generic+++$+++I think I wanna have a discussion about it with any of the ones still walking.  Can we find them?
Generic+++$+++Hey ... Dick Tracy.
Generic+++$+++Tell me that's not the same guy.
Generic+++$+++Uhh ... Wong
Generic+++$+++Wait a minute
Generic+++$+++They all pulled a bunch of jobs with Ganz about four years ago.
Generic+++$+++Who are all these?
Generic+++$+++Backup man from the East Bay. Worked with Ganz a few years ago and sprung him from the road gang.
Generic+++$+++Billy Bear...
Generic+++$+++This guy must have had a .44 like yours
Generic+++$+++I'll help you out.
Generic+++$+++Every last bit of it.  The big guy's room was empty.
Generic+++$+++Is that what this guy Ganz had in the hotel?
Generic+++$+++I dunno ... he's gonna call me...
Generic+++$+++When? How?
Generic+++$+++He ... he wants me to help him skip town.
Generic+++$+++I don't know.
Generic+++$+++I think I met her.  Now tell us something we don't know
Generic+++$+++Ganz and Billy got my girl
Generic+++$+++Who gives a fuck what you think?
Generic+++$+++You just took a shot at me
Generic+++$+++Haven't seen him for years. That's the truth.
Generic+++$+++I sure ain't his fairy godmother... now I'm looking for Ganz...where is he?
Generic+++$+++A cop...
Generic+++$+++That's what I always say.
Generic+++$+++You're impossible...
Generic+++$+++He's takin' care of the same business I'll be takin' care of - soon as I dry off.
Generic+++$+++Tell me.
Generic+++$+++Promised I'd turn my back while he... ah
Generic+++$+++Where is he?
Generic+++$+++Three more hours...
Generic+++$+++I've been waiting a long time to hear you say that.
Generic+++$+++Usual bullshit.  You make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend... You know somethin'
Generic+++$+++How'd they take it back at headquarters?
Generic+++$+++Let's go
Generic+++$+++What do I know?  I'm just a bartender.
Generic+++$+++Whaddya think?
Generic+++$+++When a guy hurts you
Generic+++$+++So what?
Generic+++$+++It might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions.  I was in bed with a girlfriend watching TV last week
Generic+++$+++Come on
Generic+++$+++What makes you think they were lesbians
Generic+++$+++How do you know?
Generic+++$+++Ganz is going to be hard to track. Just a pure schizo ... wires all crossed... totally without any pattern... kill anybody... The Indian... himself... anybody...
Generic+++$+++Nothing.  No sign of Ganz.  No sign of the Indian.  Airport's clean.  Train station. Bus station.  Docks... Shit...
Generic+++$+++I've been better...Dead end.  No Ganz
Generic+++$+++You real down?
Generic+++$+++We and my pal here have been taking it on the chin for the last few hours...
Generic+++$+++I can see that.  Pardon me for saying so
Generic+++$+++Don't.  We've had a hard night.
Generic+++$+++I ought to have you and your friend thrown out...
Generic+++$+++Fuck you.
Generic+++$+++Just a second
Generic+++$+++Jack?  What was that?
Generic+++$+++The number ... what's the Goddamn number?
Generic+++$+++So am I.
Generic+++$+++No wonder you're so popular.
Generic+++$+++Elaine! I... I'm sorry... I was expecting somebody else... police business.
Generic+++$+++I'm at work
Generic+++$+++This is not the way people who care for each other are supposed to behave.
Generic+++$+++Just one.  Some lady called.  Said she's a little hot-headed sometimes... But she still wants her occasional roommate. She'd like to talk it over after she gets off work tonight... if it's humanly possible....
Generic+++$+++I get that. The job first. Everything else
Generic+++$+++That's right.  I'm not like you. I'm not gonna sit on my ass wondering what's right and what's wrong... There's a psycho out there killing people with my gun and I'm gonna get him.  Because it's my job. And if you don't get that...
Generic+++$+++Here it comes again ... the sacred job...
Generic+++$+++I didn't get burned
Generic+++$+++Bullshit?  I'll tell you about bullshit.  My gun's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it.  It isn't my macho bullshit that's killing people
Generic+++$+++You made the front page.
Generic+++$+++Great place for lunch.
Generic+++$+++Guess people ought to know who I am...
Generic+++$+++I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge...
Generic+++$+++Thanks for the coffee.
Generic+++$+++You sure you want me to?
Generic+++$+++Call me later.
Generic+++$+++That's the way I see it
Generic+++$+++You know something
Generic+++$+++I wish you'd stop trying to make me mad so I won't care for you... I wish you'd give me a little more of a chance.
Generic+++$+++What do you want to know?  What difference does it make?  I'm the guy in your bed the last three months.  I make you feel good. You make me feel good.  What the hell else do you want from a guy?
Generic+++$+++When you start with that attitude... it's like I don't know who you are.
Generic+++$+++Maybe you don't know what the hell you're talking about.
Generic+++$+++Maybe that makes a nice excuse.
Generic+++$+++Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead.
Generic+++$+++That's a fairly crummy way to start a morning.
Generic+++$+++Maybe I would if I knew when you were coming back.
Generic+++$+++Maybe you ought to buy me one.
Generic+++$+++What makes you think I have any clean shirts at my place?
Generic+++$+++You know
Generic+++$+++I think you're ashamed to tend bar which is sad because you look great in that outfit they make you wear... You pull down four bills a week which is damn good
Generic+++$+++Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.
Generic+++$+++If this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems
Generic+++$+++I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit. But just because I think it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't know something about it.
Generic+++$+++Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit?
Generic+++$+++Positive self-image problem all over again ... You are who you decide you are unless you're the type that lets assholes decide for you.
Generic+++$+++Then I sit back and I think
Generic+++$+++I guess he got the message...
Generic+++$+++Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I'd just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker.
Generic+++$+++What'd you do?
Generic+++$+++A guy in the bar called me a dumb bitch today.
Generic+++$+++What's wrong with that?
Generic+++$+++I'm all wet.
Generic+++$+++That's the way I see it
Generic+++$+++You're hopeless.
Generic+++$+++I still don't think it's loaded.
Generic+++$+++This is a .44 Magnum
Generic+++$+++I don't think your gun's loaded...
Generic+++$+++I don't answer questions
Generic+++$+++What am I wanted for?

Generic+++$+++Why?  What's wrong with me?

Generic+++$+++...Why on earth do the stones interest you?
Generic+++$+++I'm glad you got your memory back
Generic+++$+++I remember you now..the so called art dealer.
