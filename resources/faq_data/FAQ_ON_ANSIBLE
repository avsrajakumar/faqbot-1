How do I get ansible to reuse connections, enable Kerberized SSH, or have Ansible pay attention to my local SSH config file?,    Switch your default connection type in the configuration file to ‘ssh’, or use ‘-c ssh’ to use Native OpenSSH for connections instead of the python paramiko library. In Ansible 1.2.1 and later, ‘ssh’ will be used by default if OpenSSH is new enough to support ControlPersist as an option.
How do I configure a jump host to access servers that I have no direct access to?,    With Ansible 2, you can set a ProxyCommand in the ansible_ssh_common_args inventory variable.

What is the best way to make content reusable/redistributable?,    If you have not done so already, read all about “Roles” in the playbooks documentation. This helps you make playbook content self-contained, and works well with things like git submodules for sharing content with others.If some of these plugin types look strange to you, see the API documentation for more details about ways Ansible can be extended.

How do I see a list of all of the ansible_ variables?,    Ansible by default gathers “facts” about the machines under management, and these facts can be accessed in Playbooks and in templates. To see a list of all of the facts that are available about a machine, you can run the “setup” module as an ad-hoc action.

To do this, you can just access the “$groups” dictionary in your template.
How do I access a variable name programmatically?,    An example may come up where we need to get the ipv4 address of an arbitrary interface, where the interface to be used may be supplied via a role parameter or other input. Variable names can be built by adding strings together, like so:{{ hostvars[inventory_hostname]['ansible_' + which_interface]['ipv4']['address'] }}.
How do I access a variable of the first host in a group?,    Here is a small trick: {{ hostvars[groups['webservers'][0]]['ansible_eth0']['ipv4']['address'] }}.
How do I copy files recursively onto a target host?,    The “copy” module has a recursive parameter, though if you want to do something more efficient for a large number of files, take a look at the “synchronize” module instead, which wraps rsync. See the module index for info on both of these modules.
How do I access shell environment variables?,    If you just need to access existing variables, use the ‘env’ lookup plugin.

When should I use {{ }}? Also, how to interpolate variables or dynamic variable names?,    A steadfast rule is ‘always use {{ }} except when when:‘. Conditionals are always run through Jinja2 as to resolve the expression, so when:, failed_when: and changed_when: are always templated and you should avoid adding {{}}.
Why don’t you ship in X format?,    Several reasons, in most cases it has to do with maintainability, there are tons of ways to ship software and it is a herculean task to try to support them all. In other cases there are technical issues, for example, for python wheels, our dependencies are not present so there is little to no gain.
