What is SVN, SVN or Subversion is an open source code control system. It is used to trace all the changes made to your source code or files.  It is a repository used to manage files# folders# directories and the modification made to these files over a period of time.
What is the difference between GIT and SVN repository, The difference between SVN and GIT is# Git does not support commits across multiple branches or tags. Subversion allows the creation of folders at any location in the repository layout. Gits are unchangeable while subversion enables committers to treat a tag a branch and to create multiple revisions under a tag root. Git is less preferred for handling large files or frequently changing binary files while SVN is capable of handling multiple projects stored in the same repository.
List out what all things should be stored in the SVN repository, Source Code# Build scripts# Test data used by QA# DB schema# Project settings (When the whole team is using the same IDE)# Project documentation (Internal and External)# Minutes of meetings# significant e-mails# and info from the web# Expensively generated artifacts# And other documents related to the project.
What is the command to add a file or dir, svn add filename and svn add dirname
List out the common subversion commands, Import. Checkout. Commit. Update.
What is the difference between commit and update, Update is used to update the local workspace with the changes made by the team to the repository# while commit is the process to implement changes from local to repository# in simple words# upload a file into the repository.
Explain how you can apply a patch in SVN, To apply a patch in SVN# you are required to Create Patch by making changes and generating the .diff file.  Then this .diff file can be implemented to the new code base using Apply Patch.
What is the command to create a new directory under version control, svn mkdir directory# svn mkdir http://url/directory.
How you can import your existing directory into the new repository, The command you will use to import your existing directory into the new repository you have to write# svn import/home/mysurface/programming file:///home/mysurface/repo/programing_repo-m initial import.
What is the command to see what is inside the repository, Command svn list file:///home/mysurface/repo/programming_repo is used to see what is inside the repository.
What is the command to view the difference between the local version and repository version, The command used to view the difference between the local and repository version is# svn diff filename# svn diff dirname.
Mention what does the result codes G and R in svn indicates, The result codes G and R in svn indicates # G code: Changes on the repo were automatically merged into the working copy# R code: This code indicates that the item has been replaced in your working copy. This means the file was programmed or scheduled for deletion# and a new file with the same name was scheduled for addition in its place.
Mention what is the function of Revert in subversion,  Revert function will remove your local changes and reload the latest version from the repository.
Explain how you can revert to a previous version, To retrieve a previous version# you have to use revert command. But revert command will simply erase local edits# what you actually need is to merge command. For example# you have a file [abc.txt] and the current version is 101# and you want version 201. Then you will use the command like svn merge r 101:201 abc.txt svn commit m Reverted to revision 201 abc.txt
Which commands can be used to move some subset of code and history of this code from one SVN repo to another, Following commands can be used svnadmin dump svndumpfilter include svnadmin load svn remove.
List out what is the best practices for SVN, Update and Test before commit Work from your own local workspace Commit small autonomous changes Validate the files you are committing# you actually changed Keep in touch with repository Watch for conflicts Always group your check-in logically Use comment
Explain what checkout command is and how to use the checkout command in SVN, Check-Out command in SVN is used to create a local workable copy of your project retrieved from the local repository. For example# you have a project located in the repository created at URL location http://www.guru99.com/svn/myrepo/myproject.  So you have to checkout myproject into your local system assuming myrepo is a public repository. You will use code. svn co http://www.guru99.com/svn/myrepo/myproject . This command will copy all your files to your current directory. If you want checkout the directory which is in a private repository# you will then use the following command svn co http://www.guru99.com/svn/privaterepo/myproject username admin password admin.
Explain the terminologies trunk batch and tag, Trunk: it is a mainstream of development present in SVN repository created at the start and exists till the end of a project. Branch: it is copy derived from a trunk. It flows in direction of certain changes without disturbing other users. Multiple branches can be created each having its own path of code changes for different functionalities. Tag: display milestones in the repository history section# where major changes are done or points where code revision is done.
Why revert command is used in subversion, Local Revert: it removes the changes done recently that are done after update command is run and before those changes are committed in a repository. Repo Revert: it removes changes done on a repository level.
How to check the content of a repository, In SVN you can see the tree structure of all the directories# folders# files present under any given repository. There are subversion commands that help in this.
Is it possible to add a file directly in the repository , Yes# the same is possible and the users can go ahead with the command svn add filename and svn add dirname
Can you tell how in Subversion# how the command commit can be put separated from the command update, When it comes to updating the local workspace# the command which is used often is Update. It reflects all the modifications made to the document by any member of the team. On the other side# the Commit make sure to implement properly the same modifications made to the data from present location to the repository. It can also be said that it simply upload the files and the documents in the repository without making the users to made any sort of efforts.
Why do you think there is a need to made changes to the files# documents or the source codes in businesses, business management is itself a very vast term. There are tasks and decisions that are properly based on data and information. When it comes to executing them# businesses often test them in different manners. The reports are generated accordingly and the new outcomes achieved are often considered and is clubbed with the existing information. Thus# the changes to the documents# files and source code are frequent. In other words# any sort of changes are made because of no other reason but the betterment of the business.
In Subversion# is it possible for the users to apply a patch directly in a subsection without taking the entire document into consideration, The same is possible and there are certain methods to keep up the pace for this. The users are always in a position to get the things done in the shortest possible time. On the best methods for this is to create a patch. This can be done with the help of .diff file The same can then be considered in the new code base and the user are free to make use of the command Apply Patch for this.
Suppose you need to verify what exactly is present inside a repository# how you will do this," Execute the following command for this. "".svn list file"""
How the file from the svn repo can be erased, .svn delete filename
By making use of a single command# can you list the entire COS in SVN," Yes# there are some dedicated commands available for the same. One that you can execute is ""Ct lsco-me""."
Why is JIRA used, Atlassian JIRA is basically an issue and project tracking tool which allows us to track any project related work by following a proper workflow.
Explain JIRA workflow, The workflow here includes the creation of an issue# series of actions performed to fix the issue and the last step includes the closing or say completion of the issue after verification.
Enlist the report types generated by JIRA, Average Age Report# Created vs Resolved issue Report# Pie Chart Report# Control chart# Navigated to desired project dashboard# etc...
Explain the step by step procedure of how an issue is created in JIRA, Log in to your JIRA account by using valid credentials and get directed to the dashboard. Click on Create button displayed and you will be navigated to a window for creating an issue. Enter all the necessary details as required to create an issue.
Explain the three color indicators and their significance in JIRA , For any particular issue in JIRA# 3 colors like Blue# Green and Orange is used to denote the amount of time spent on any particular issue. Blue denote the Original Estimate# Orange determines the time left for resolving# Green defines the actual time that has been used.
For any particular issue in JIRA# what all are included under change history, Creation and deletion of a comment. Creation and deletion of an issue link. Deletion of a worklog. File attachment changes. Issue field changes
Mention a way with which an issue can be shared with other users in JIRA , An issue can be shared with other users in JIRA by using the share option available on the issue description page.
What is the importance of labeling issue in JIRA, Labeling an issue is basically done to categorize an issue within a particular section which in turn can be easily searched with the help of labels.
How is an issue linked in JIRA, There are two fields available in JIRA: Linked issues and Issues. Linked issue section contains the dropdown for the options to be selected as the reason for linking the issue.
What is the purpose of JIRA dashboard, The first page which is displayed whenever we get logged in to JIRA application is Dashboard which is basically the default or system dashboard.
What do you mean by Scheduling an issue in JIRA, Scheduling the issue means scheduling the work of issue for a particular due date.
Explain how particular project details are listed in JIRA , Every project has some main attributes which have to be displayed in the project summary. This includes Name# key# components# versions.
What are issues types that are created and tracked via JIRA, JIRA has some defined set of default issue types which are displayed under Issue Type section. Other issue types can be added# edited and deleted as per requirement of the project. Some of the common issue types are Bug# Task# Sub-task# Epic# Story# etc.
How is a sub-task created in JIRA, Sub-task is the way of splitting up of parent issue into a number of small tasks which are tracked and worked on separately.
Explain the term Cloning an issue in JIRA , Cloning an issue means copying an issue.
Explain Kanban board in JIRA, Kanban boards are created for the projects where the team has their prime focus on visualizing the workflow and managing the projects work in progress.
Mention one similarity and one difference between JIRA Scrum and JIRA Kanban, Both JIRA Scrum and Kanban is considered as the most powerful process tool for optimization of work and the processes as both processes focus is on continuous optimization and visualizing the workflow.  Scrum board is the work mode where progress of sprints and tracking of its work is done. Here the team determines the list of issues that has become backlog and then these issues are moved to sprints as per team plan.
What are the most useful JIRA add-ons, Jenkins-CI# Usersnap# Slack# HipChat# GitHub# PagerDuty# Tempo Timesheets.
What comes under JIRA Schema, Workflows# Issue types# Custom fields# Screens# Field configurations# Notifications# Permissions
How is security setting helpful in JIRA? Security setting for any issue is defined or say set either at the time of creation of the issue or while editing the issue.,
A short note on JIRA reports, JIRA withholds a classified list of reports to depict the project statistics to the user.
What is Jira Core and its uses and who are Jira core project administrators, It is an efficient workflow management system which allows formulating unique process. this utility allows to both increase and decreases the complexity of the workflows. this allows implying more importance on the process involved.
Can an Issue be assigned to two different people# Explain Cloning issue# then what are linked issues, JIRA does not support assignation of the same issue under two different people at the same instance of time. this maintains the stability that one multiple developer can never be tagged to the same issue ever. But at several instances based on the intensity and volume of work the issue or bug may generate there could be a possibility of tagging more than one resources to the same issue.
Adding Gadgets to JIRA dashboard, Several gadgets can be added to JIRA personal dashboards. The JIRA admin is responsible for adding a gadget to a default dashboard of a JIRA application.
What languages and platforms does your static scanner support?,"Veracode allows you to scan Java, JSP, .NET- C#, .NET - VB.NET, ASP.NET, .NET - C+/CLI, C/C+, PHP, ColdFusion, iOS, Android, J2ME, Ruby, Classic ASP, VBScript, VB6, Flash (using Dynamic), COBOL, and JavaScript for mobile and web applications! Our list of supported platforms and languages is always growing"
What email notifications will I get from Veracode?,"Veracode keeps customers up to date with scan and overall service status via email. Veracode users will receive emails when: Password is changed, Pre-scan verification is complete, Scan is submitted, and Scan has completed."
What is pre-scan verification?,"The Veracode platform performs a preliminary analysis, or Pre-Scan, of your binaries to validate that they can be analyzed and to give you an opportunity to fix problems with the uploaded files before submitting your scan request. The results of the Pre-Scan verification are given as messages in the module table; summary information appears as you select modules to be scanned."
I received an email saying there was an issue scanning my application. What should I do?, Veracode will send a scan failure email if issues are encountered scanning your application. Our engineering team will work with you to resolve any issues like this and ensure scan success.
What is the difference between a Flaw and a Vulnerability?," Veracode scan highlights flaws discovered in a submitted binary. It is important to understand that not all flaws will be exploitable vulnerabilities. A flaw is a potential vulnerability. A flaw is a pattern that is flagged in the analyzed binary that is indicative of a vulnerability. A vulnerability is a hole within the security of a system caused by software flaws, incorrect configurations and/or insecure user behavior. "
What flaw categories do you look for?,"Input Validation, Memory Corruption, Numeric Errors, Cryptographic Issues"
Why do I upload my binaries to Veracode? Do you also need my source code?,Veracode s automated static binary analysis reviews the final integrated application without requiring organizations to expose their intellectual property in the form of source code.
Why should I use Veracode instead of a desktop source code analyzer?,"Veracode is out to change the world of software by solving this application security challenge in a fundamentally different and better way. Our cloud-based application risk management services platform offers the industry s most complete, accurate and easy to use application security testing, developer training and application intelligence services."
Why do I need to package my java app as a war file?,"Veracode expects Java web applications to be submitted in a standard WAR format. This is so that, regardless of the application server technology being used, Veracode can correctly analyze the data and control flow of the application and understand the application boundaries. Veracode understands standard J2EE application packages, including JAR, WAR, and EAR."
How long will it take to get my results?,"Veracode performs a fully automated scan on uploaded applications, including constructing a model of the data and control flow and identifying any flaws. The turnaround time depends on the size and complexity of the application, but on average Veracode analyzes 75% of all uploaded Java applications in six hours or less."
I only see the source file and line number where the issue exists. How can I tell where the attack is coming from?,"Each cross-site scripting flaw in the Veracode service carries two types of information: the location at which the flaw is exposed to the end user, and the data or control flow through which a tainted attack string travels to reach the vulnerable part of the code. You can view this control flow in the Call Stack view"
"I like the Veracode web interface, but I do all my work in my IDE. Can you show me the results there? I also would like to upload my application directly as part of my build script rather than visiting the Veracode UI.","Veracode provides APIs for uploading applications and viewing results, and includes reference integrations to several bugtracking systems and integrated development environments, including Eclipse and Visual Studio."
Does the Veracode Eclipse Plugin work with other Eclipse-derived IDEs?,"The Veracode Eclipse Plugin may run on Eclipse-derived IDEs like Spring Suite, but Veracode does not provide support for these IDEs."
How do I check prescan results in the API?,"Prescans usually complete very quickly and you receive email notifications when they complete. If you want to check for prescan results using the Upload API, use the getprescanresults.do call."
"How do I run an API scan if there are ""unsupported frameworks"" warnings in my prescan results?","If you want to ensure the scan completes even though there are non-fatal errors such as unsupported frameworks, ensure you use the scan_all_top_level_modules parameter when you use the beginscan.do call. Alternately, you can use scan_selected_modules, scan_previously_selected_modules, or modules with a list of module IDs, returned by the prescan."
How do I use the API to query tags in the Results API?,"If you want to query tags in applications, you can add unique tags as metadata when creating your applications. You can then query your applications based on any of the metadata. Use createapp.do to create an application with metadata. Use the following calls of the Results API to get the scan results of applications: getapplist.do to get the full list of your applications and then getappinfo.do to get information for a specific application, including any metadata, if applicable. To get a detailed report for any application, call detailedreport.do, which returns the results in an XML document."
Why does Veracode use passwords for API integrations? I thought passwords were inherently insecure.,"Veracode recommends that you change to using the Veracode API ID and key with HMAC signing, where possible, because this method provides maximum protection against man-in-the-middle and session replay attacks. User credential authentication using username and password is only supported on the Veracode XML APIs, which are the legacy APIs, while the REST APIs are the newer APIs that Veracode offers."
"Why does my run history show updated records when I did not update any records, but only created records?","New field values created in a destination endpoint during synchronization are automatically sent back the record in the source endpoint.

So, for example, when you create a record in ALM and synchronize it to ALM Octane, that new record is created in ALM Octane, and assigned an ALM Octane ID.

ALM Octane Synchronizer recognizes this new ID field value, and sends it back to ALM, adding it to the source record.

This last step is the update you see in your run history."
I modified my link to fix errors that occurred in previous synchronizations. Why do I see these same errors occurring again?,"If your link is in automatic mode, and a synchronization ran with errors, the records with errors are not necessarily fixed in subsequent runs.

This may happen if the errors occurred because of changes outside of the link configuration, such as if the schema changed, but the field mapping was not updated. If you fix the cause of the error (such as refreshing the Field Mapping tab and map the new fields), ALM Octane Synchronizer will re-synchronize those records if changes in the actual record are detected.

ALM Octane Synchronizer also periodically re-synchronizes all records, including those that had run with errors, but have had no subsequent changes.

To ensure that records that ran with errors are re-synchronized in the next upcoming run, manually set the link to re-synchronize those records.

For details, see Re-synchronizing records with fixed errors (automatic mode only)."
Why is the Search Links box in the link tree disabled?,You cannot search in the link tree when a link is in edit mode. Save any changes or click Cancel Edit to enable the search box.
"Why can’t I access Synchronizer? I keep getting to a login page.
","In certain cases you may try to open Synchronizer and a login page appears but you cannot log in. In this case you need to modify your authentication cookies setting, as described in Install the Synchronizer."
Why can't I edit mapped requirement types in my synchronization link?,"After a link is synchronized, you can no longer remove mapped requirement types. You can still add types that are not yet mapped."
"Synchronization failed due to unmapped users. What should I do?
","When synchronization fails because of unmapped users, check if the missing users exist. If they do not, you can create them in ALM Octane (either as active users, or inactive). When you run synchronization again, the ALM users that were missing will be mapped to the newly-created users in ALM Octane. For details on adding or activating users in ALM Octane, see Assign roles and permissions and Assign roles and permissions.
"
During synchronization I received an error: “Some of the mapped fields were deleted from ALM Octane.”,"This error indicates that user defined fields were removed from ALM Octane, which were mapped in a synchronization link. The list of missing fields is displayed in the UI.

Edit the relevant link within the Synchronizer UI, and click Refresh fields and field values in the Field mapping tab. All the removed fields will be removed from field mapping. Run an integrity check to verify that records will be synchronized correctly."
During synchronization I received an error: “Some of the fields used in the filter were deleted from ALM Octane.”,"This error indicates that you removed user defined fields from ALM Octane, which were used in a Synchronizer filter within a particular synchronization link.

Either edit the existing filter, or create a new filter without the user defined fields that no longer exist. If you create a new filter, within the Synchronizer UI edit the appropriate link and change the Synchronizer filter in the General tab. Run an integrity check to verify that records will be synchronized correctly."
Why is ALM Octane Synchronizer failing to find a custom field that was OK in the past?,"Check the list of custom fields defined in ALM Octane: 

In Settings , clickand select a shared space or a workspace.
In Entities, click User-defined Fields and select the entity whose fields you want to check.
Make sure that the field in question still defined for the workspace you are synchronizing."
Why is the synchronization adding attachments named attachment.url to the ALM Octane entities?,"This may happen if an ALM entity has an attachment whose name contains special characters (~!@#$%()^&).

Workaround: On ALM Octane, remove the added attachment. On ALM, rename the attachment so that it does not contain special characters."
Why am I not receiving emails after configuring Issue notifications?,"If you configured Issue notifications but you are not receiving emails as expected, define values for FROM_EMAIL_ADDRESS & MAIL_SERVER_HOST in the sync_sa schema."
What does my basic subscription include?,"You will be able to track your daily victories and setbacks, lifestyle contributors on a weekly level, and your overall well being on a monthly basis (depression, anxiety, connectedness, etc.) - each of which provide some basic summary stats. You can also access a portion of the training (Week 1) - and progress in the gamified levels. Along with being able to participate in a “daily discussion,” you can access SOS anytime (for immediate support), and a place to journal thoughts and create your own Freedom Plan (aiming for longer-term progress). In addition to being able to participate in monthly “Fortify chats,” you’ll be able to explore our professional directory as well."
How long does Fortify take?,"There is no set amount of time to move through Fortify. The training can be explored in whatever time frame feels comfortable. We provide a 12-week pathway as one option. We encourage people to take whatever time they need - and not to rush or go too fast. Participation in the Daily Tracker, webinars, forums, groups and in personalized coaching are open-ended – and can go as long as someone needs."
"How can I know if Fortify is right for me?
","Try it out for yourself! One of the purposes of the free basic access is to give people a chance to experience Fortify directly for themselves and see if it feels like a good fit. We respect that there are many other kinds of supports that may also be very helpful. In fact, we mention many of them within Fortify to encourage people to look around for anything that can be personally impactful. We definitely want you to go with what is right for you!"
"How do I get in touch with the Fortify team?
","Send us a note! We’re reachable at info@joinfortify.com. After logging in, you can also find us in the bottom left corner anytime you need. We look forward to hearing from you."
How does Fortify ensure that my subscription is anonymous?,"Fortify does not, nor would not, share any user information – with industry standard data security protections in place. At sign-up, all we need connected to you personally is a working email address. You can use a pseudonym if you prefer. The username you create upon signing up also doesn’t have to identify you in any way and will be the only way the community will see you. If you sign-up for a Fortify group or coach, they will only know you by your custom username as well. Lastly, your bank statements will show charges from Impact Collective, LLC not Fortify."
How do I speed up management inside EC2?,Don’t try to manage a fleet of EC2 machines from your laptop. Connect to a management node inside EC2 first and run Ansible from there.
"Can I get training on Ansible or find commercial support?
","Yes! See our Guru offering for online support, and support is also included with Ansible Tower. You can also read our service page and email info@ansible.com for further details."
"Is there a web interface / REST API / etc?

","Yes! Ansible, Inc makes a great product that makes Ansible even more powerful and easy to use. See Ansible Tower."
"How do I submit a change to the documentation?
","Great question! Documentation for Ansible is kept in the main project git repository, and complete instructions for contributing can be found in the docs README viewable on GitHub. Thanks!"
