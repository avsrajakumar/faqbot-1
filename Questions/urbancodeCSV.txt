What kind of environment do I need to run UrbanCode Velocity?;High availability UrbanCode Velocity installs are built in through the use of a container platform. It runs on any Kubernetes cluster in a local data center or public cloud. We recommend a minimum of three VMs with 8 GB RAM for the Kubernetes master and two workers. Additional VMs increase scale.
Do you have a sponsor user program? How can customers join?;Yes. There is a sponsor users program where customers can work with our design and development teams to help shape the product. It also provides participating customers with an inside an inside look into the product’s evolution.
What deployment tools does UrbanCode Velocity integrate with?;You can use UrbanCode Velocity to manage your deployments from Jenkins or UrbanCode Deploy.
Can I use UrbanCode Deploy to automate the deployment of containers?;Yes. IBM UrbanCode® Deploy can manage containers.
Is UrbanCode Deploy available as a software-as-a-service offering?;Yes. UrbanCode Deploy on Cloud is an SaaS solution with UrbanCode Deploy as its foundation. UrbanCode Deploy is a best-in-class application-release automation solution that makes deploying applications predictable, repeatable and auditable.
How does UrbanCode Deploy integrate with plug-ins?;You can integrate IBM UrbanCode Deploy into your delivery pipeline and avoid restructuring your toolchain with over 130 plug-ins for development, testing, infrastructure and cloud — such as the Jenkins Pipeline and VMware vRealize Automation plug-ins.
How does UrbanCode Deploy handle complex application deployments?;UrbanCode Deploy can enable you to create models of the deployment process with a graphical process editor, replacing manual steps and nonstandard scripts. No programming is required. You can create processes of any complexity, assign them to deployment environments and execute them more reliably.
For provisioning cloud images and deploying applications, how does the IBM UrbanCode Blueprint Designer work?;You can deploy to any platform — mainframe, data center, cloud or virtualized environments — and deploy containers with control and visibility. Manage and participate in your deployment process from anywhere with the UrbanCode mobile iOS app. 
What safeguards are in UrbanCode Deploy that help ensure quality?;You can store different configuration settings for each target and enable configuration-only or traditional code-and-configuration deployments, while reusing the same application process across multiple environments.
Does UrbanCode Deploy natively deploy applications to IBM z/OS®?;Yes. A DevOps transformation includes enhancing z/OS for development practices. Mobile applications make hundreds of millions of IBM z Systems® back-end calls every day — for example, calls to COBOL and PL/1. The mainframe must be part of the modern development and operations practices.
How do I discover, deploy and manage IBM WebSphere® Application Server configurations?;UrbanCode Deploy detects WebSphere Application Server automatically and creates corresponding resources on the server. You can import WebSphere Application Server cell and cluster configurations, and generate a template that is stored and promoted across environments.
How do I know who deployed what, and where and when it was deployed?;UrbanCode Deploy provides a customizable permission system for your users and a more secure transport of your deployment artifacts. You can track user activity (who, what, where and when) with control and audit capabilities that build a full history of an application deployment.
What is the difference between the UrbanCode Velocity Standard and Community editions?;The Community Edition is a free download that enables you to create release reports using data from UrbanCode Deploy. The Standard Edition is a paid product that enables you to do everything you can do with the Community Edition, plus more complex release management and pipeline deployment setup.
Is UrbanCode Velocity a deployment automation tool?;No. UrbanCode Deploy provides deployment automation. UrbanCode Velocity provides coordination across continuous delivery pipelines from one or more tools, so it can coordinate across multiple Jenkins pipelines, UrbanCode Deploy applications, or both.
How is UrbanCode Velocity installed?;UrbanCode Velocity has been containerized and provides a Helm chart for installation into a Kubernetes cluster, in addition to instructions for deploying as a Docker Compose application.
How does UrbanCode Velocity help improve team performance?;UrbanCode Velocity provides reports showing the time required to get a new build into production. The reports highlight bottlenecks by identifying which environments the build spent time in, slowing delivery to production. This can help teams address those bottlenecks to speed delivery.
What information is provided by the audit reports?;The audit reports include the name of the deployed application, the components deployed, the application version, the component versions, the process used for deployment, the target environment, the result, the requester, the approver and the timing data.
