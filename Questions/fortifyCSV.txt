My application does not allow concurrent logins. When I run a scan with WI I get error messages which i suspect is due to concurrent login attempts. Is there any way by which I enable WI to manage concurrent sessions in my application?;A solution to this problem is to convert the recorded credentials in a login macro to parameters and use multiple login accounts with the same application privileges. You can use the Multi-user Login option in the Scan Settings: Authentication window to parameterize the username and password in a login macro, and define multiple username and password pairs to use in a scan. This approach allows the scan to run across multiple threads. Each thread has a different login session, resulting in faster scan times.

Unable to start hp webinspect trusted certificate web server;After installing WebInspect, it is important to open the MSIE browser and accept the certificate/plugin prompted.  This adds a WebInspect certificate to the browser, for use later when using Web Proxy for a variety of recording tasks.  One of those tasks does happen to include the Native Mobile app scanning, where WebInspect essentially turns itself into an intercept proxy to capture the mobile application's activity.
